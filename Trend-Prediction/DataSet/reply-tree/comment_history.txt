As a doctor, I spent many hours giving free expert medical advice to my brother-in-law who is a medical malpractice lawyer who went from
conservative to liberal. I recently texted him to ask if Hunter Biden was getting bad legal advice in pursuing a reduction in child support
since the requisite discovery aspect of the case would expose all of his nefarious financial dealings. Not a single peep out of my
brother-in-law. Thanks a lot! Maybe I should bill him for my time.
