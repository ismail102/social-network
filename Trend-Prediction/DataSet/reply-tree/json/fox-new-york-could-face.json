Districts should be drawn to the most compact geographical area possible, to encompass a set number of citizens.  This should be done without regard to race, religion, or political persuasion.  Districts should never look like snakes.  Snakes are bad.  Look at the Illinois congressional district map for an example of extreme gerrymandering.",

The General Assembly first attempted to accomplish this objective through legislation in 1862, but the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional (Opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court, 30 Conn. 591, 1862 WL 941 (Conn.)), thus necessitating a constitutional amendment. The amendment was effective only for the duration of the war.\nAfter the war, absentee voting was not addressed in the constitution until 1932, through Article XXXIX of the Amendments to the 1818 Constitution. (In 1918 the legislature passed a temporary absentee voting law for World War I soldiers.) The 1932 amendment allowed the General Assembly to enact legislation establishing absentee voting privileges for individuals who could not appear at the polls because of absence from their city or town, sickness, or physical disability. In 1964, the privilege was extended to include individuals whose religion forbids secular activity on the day of an election (Article XII of the Amendments to the 1955 Constitution). These provisions are now codified in Article VI, Section Seven of the current constitution. Legislation authorizing the use of absentee ballots is codified at CGS \u00a7 9-135.\nTry again, child.",
