Ask them what they know about how healthcare systems operate in other countries, such as what's the difference between the systems in the UK, Germany, and Japan, you are likely to get a blank stare or some ignorant, facile talking points about socialism.

In the Security Council there are the 5 Great Powers comprised of the US, Great Britain, France, Russia (USSR), and China.  These are also known as the 5 permanent members.  There are also 10 non-permanent members being held on a rotating basis.  Any one of the 5 permanent members can veto any Security Council resolution.  \nIn the case of the recent vote regarding aid to Hamas (Gaza), the US by abstaining to vote effectively voted 'Yes' in support of UN funding for Hamas.",

I wholeheartedly support Israel's decree that they will not stop until Hamas no longer exists.  They have got to get rid of Hamas or this will happen again and again.  Recent polls show up to 75% Palestinian support for Hamas, so there is no reason to try to save them either.  It doesn't sound like there is a good solution for freeing the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th.  Israel should, and probably will, just ignore the UN Security Council's resolution; and the US needs to pull out of the UN.  It is just a huge waste of our money and we get nothing for it.",
