The harrowing experiences shared by women, like the intense pain and lasting regret from abortion pills, starkly contradict the narrative of ease and safety often promoted. True pro-life values demand full disclosure and informed consent, respecting the sanctity of life and the well-being of mothers. Policies should emphasize comprehensive care and alternatives, like adoption or support services, not merely expedite a process that leaves lasting scars. It's time for leadership that genuinely upholds the dignity of life and provides women with truthful, compassionate alternatives. Women, and the unborn, deserve a government that protects, not one that pushes them into choices without full understanding and support.",

It is heartbreaking and uncalled for.\n\nWhile I have no idea as to your personal faith, I want to assure you that the Lord and Savior I know - Jesus - does not condemn you.  I can only imagine the ache you carry with you in your soul following the abortions.  Jesus can heal that.  He is willing to forgive if you sincerely ask for His forgiveness.\n\nI do not pass judgement on you, nor do I condemn you.  What good would judgement or condemnation do?  What good would spitting hurtful words at you do?  None.  Absolutely none.\n\nYou were created by God - on purpose, and for a good purpose!  He also created your four children, on purpose, and for a good purpose.  While they are not here physically, I know without a shadow of a doubt, that their souls and spirits are alive, and with Jesus this very moment!  He is the Rock of Ages, and He loves YOU - no matter what you have done, or failed to do.\n\nI will be praying for that ache to be healed, and I applaud your work now to oppose abortion.  \n\nIf you do not know Jesus, I pray that you will pick up the Bible and learn about Him.  He and He alone can fill that void in all of us that needs filling.\n\nYou are loved.  Thank you for so bravely sharing your story.  Once again, I am so sorry for all of the hate.  We are better than that.  Each of us fights wars that no one else (but Jesus!) understands.  It costs nothing to be kind, and I hope kindness is what I have shown you through my words today.  \u2665\ufe0f",
