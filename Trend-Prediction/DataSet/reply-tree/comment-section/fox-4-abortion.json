You barely touch on the emotional damage, which could be eliminated with the use of the resources you give less time to than your pain. Abortion is murder, murdering your child will at some point cause emotional trauma and hopefully spiritual trauma when you come to faith. God will forgive and a mother can repent, change her lifestyle and heal. God will open His arms to all these mothers and participatory fathers if they come to Him in humility and seeking forgivness. The babies are already safe with God, He loved them at conception. ",

Guys don't buy you drinks or give you drugs for free unless they're getting something in return.  If that's how you want to live, go to planned parenthood or a doctor and get a prescription for birth control, or get the shot, or an IUD. If you aren't willing to go through with the pregnancy, give birth and give the child to someone else who will actually love and provide care, then keep your legs crossed, quit getting high, or report your rapist to the police department.  Women need to realize that they don't have to give in. I thank God for my 3 children and my grandchildren, and I'm glad I never got pregnant when I was young, impressionable, and foolish, but I was fortunate, and God didn't give me more than I could handle. Youth today have it all out in the open, and a lot more options.  Responsibility should be taught in school, not that they can do whatever, whenever, and that they can expect no repercussions with that.",

The harrowing experiences shared by women, like the intense pain and lasting regret from abortion pills, starkly contradict the narrative of ease and safety often promoted. True pro-life values demand full disclosure and informed consent, respecting the sanctity of life and the well-being of mothers. Policies should emphasize comprehensive care and alternatives, like adoption or support services, not merely expedite a process that leaves lasting scars. It's time for leadership that genuinely upholds the dignity of life and provides women with truthful, compassionate alternatives. Women, and the unborn, deserve a government that protects, not one that pushes them into choices without full understanding and support.",

Our relationship soured and she became violent towards me. We separated and after 6 years of \"marriage\" she filed for divorce which I happily gave her. I got the bills and she got the goods. I was not bitter toward her just saddened a bit. After nine years of being happily divorced I met the woman that was intended to be my wife all along. Unfortunately she was not able to conceive, so we went to Russia to adopt the son that God was saving for us. He is 22 now and in the US Air Force.",

It is heartbreaking and uncalled for.\n\nWhile I have no idea as to your personal faith, I want to assure you that the Lord and Savior I know - Jesus - does not condemn you.  I can only imagine the ache you carry with you in your soul following the abortions.  Jesus can heal that.  He is willing to forgive if you sincerely ask for His forgiveness.\n\nI do not pass judgement on you, nor do I condemn you.  What good would judgement or condemnation do?  What good would spitting hurtful words at you do?  None.  Absolutely none.\n\nYou were created by God - on purpose, and for a good purpose!  He also created your four children, on purpose, and for a good purpose.  While they are not here physically, I know without a shadow of a doubt, that their souls and spirits are alive, and with Jesus this very moment!  He is the Rock of Ages, and He loves YOU - no matter what you have done, or failed to do.\n\nI will be praying for that ache to be healed, and I applaud your work now to oppose abortion.  \n\nIf you do not know Jesus, I pray that you will pick up the Bible and learn about Him.  He and He alone can fill that void in all of us that needs filling.\n\nYou are loved.  Thank you for so bravely sharing your story.  Once again, I am so sorry for all of the hate.  We are better than that.  Each of us fights wars that no one else (but Jesus!) understands.  It costs nothing to be kind, and I hope kindness is what I have shown you through my words today.  \u2665\ufe0f",

There will be a time when we all answer for our wrong and evil actions in this life. The only way we can find forgiveness for them, is to ask the Lord to forgive us of them. It is not that it is so hard to do this, but that it opens the door most never want to have opened for some reason or another... Believing in God!

Some do and some don't, which reveals, to them at least, to what degree they value human life as such.\nThere is a correlation between a woman's valuation of her own life and the life of her unborn child, the greater the first the greater the latter, and vice versa.\nThat valuation depends on their inner nature, spiritually, and their intellectual understanding. The latter is largely dependent on how they were raised as children and youth, what moral understanding they were given.\nSadly, in America most people no longer have a solid moral foundation based on understanding given when they were young, because their parents weren't brought up with much understanding either.",

They argue for abortions to make it easier for them, but never mention the consequences of killing their baby.  Plenty of options to prevent these pregnancies from happening, which is the best solution for both the woman and unborn baby.  Stop feeling sorry for your selves and consider the fate of the 4 babies you're killing, simply because you have been completely irresponsible and then, of all things, want sympathy.  I hope you didn't get paid for this story, but something tells me you did.  You have zero conscience..",

It concerned me to see so very many military spouses getting pregnant for the sixth or seventh time and using abortion essentially as a birth control method. Not sure if that has changed since I discharged in 1990, but we didn't have the failure to identify men from women back then as a headache to endure either. I pity what must be endured these days in the military world and the civilian world, as it is a pure mess for sure. God be with our troops and God bless America and Texas, too! ",
