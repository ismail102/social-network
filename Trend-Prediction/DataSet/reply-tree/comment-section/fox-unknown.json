Of my child decides it wants to transition without my knowledge and I find out what is going on and decide to put that child up for adoption does that make me a bad person because I decided to transition to an empty nester?? Curious where people draw this wet noddle line at. They might not want to be a specific gender, but I may just decide I don\u2019t want to be called a parent anymore. You know\u2026.since kids know everything and us adults don\u2019t. So glad my 5 had great childhood\u2019s with lots of love and support and not any democrat influence. ",
