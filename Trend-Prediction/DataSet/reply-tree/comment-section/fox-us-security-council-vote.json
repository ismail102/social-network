There is very little reporting on events in the rest of the world, such as the expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank or settler violence. If you asked a Fox viewer why Israel is called an apartheid state most couldn't answer because they are mostly familiar with daily political polls and the Hunter Biden obsession. Ask them what they know about how healthcare systems operate in other countries, such as what's the difference between the systems in the UK, Germany, and Japan, you are likely to get a blank stare or some ignorant, facile talking points about socialism.

With FDRs death it was up to Truman to make the policy happen. The charter took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; as of 2023, it has 193. ",

As an outsider it is so easy to see the world discriminating against Israel.  Europe eliminated the Jews in WWII and to show case their diversity imported 20 million Muslims and Europe is now paying the price.  Countries like India have paid the price dearly for having too many Muslims.  Rapes, riots, crimes, ghettos, etc. follow Muslims wherever they go.   If all the civilized nations of the world stand with Israel and say with one voice \"Hamas has to be eliminated for what they did on October 7th\" and send troops and their military might to support Israel and crush Hamas, the Middle East will quiet down in no time.     German women already suffered on the New Year's Eve after importing 5 Millions Muslims but that is just the beginning as Muslims flood Europe and the US.   \nAn Indian grandmother cannot get a visa for the UK but 5 million muslims can walk into Europe.

In broadest terms there are two parts of the UN, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council.  \nEverything important gets handled by the Security Council.  In the Security Council there are the 5 Great Powers comprised of the US, Great Britain, France, Russia (USSR), and China.  These are also known as the 5 permanent members.  There are also 10 non-permanent members being held on a rotating basis.  Any one of the 5 permanent members can veto any Security Council resolution.  \nIn the case of the recent vote regarding aid to Hamas (Gaza), the US by abstaining to vote effectively voted 'Yes' in support of UN funding for Hamas.",

It could be argued that what happened on Oct 7th was Israel 'reaping what they sowed'; but I would disagree with that as well, because I actually do think that war crimes and atrocities are unacceptable no matter who is doing it. Unlike you, who makes excuses for Israel when they commit war crimes and slaughter over 20,000 civilians in less than four months. ",

It doesn't sound like there is a good solution for freeing the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th.

Unhindered support of Israel was making the US look like hypocrites in the world, and creating lots of enemies for us. \nUN has been saying for a week now that 50% of Gazans are starving and 100% are not getting food everyday. \nMore than 50% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed.\nThree-fourths of their hospitals are out of service when they need them the most.\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, and 70% of the dead in Gaza are children and women. \nAnalysis is showing that Israel dropped more than 500 2,000-lb bombs in a very populated area. These bombs have a kill area of more than 40 soccer fields.\nMany Republicans say us supporting Ukraine is creating a security issue for us. But it is not as the whole world is against Russia invading Ukraine. The world overwhelmingly is against us unconditionally supporting Israel as they indiscrimantely kill Palestinians. It is is going to create many many terrorists in the Muslim world who see people like them being butchered. The longer this goes the worst it will be for Israel and the US. ",
