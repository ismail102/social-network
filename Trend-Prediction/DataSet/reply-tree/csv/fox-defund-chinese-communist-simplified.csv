If you were taking pictures with a camera that's another thing. If it was a long range telephoto set up, you could be there a very long time. Months ago, next to the seaward facing SEAL training base, I met an operatives who first claimed to be Japanese, then said he came from Hong Kong. Then tried to convince me he was from San Diego speaking in an English that was broken and like he had marbles in his mouth. Normally, there are lifeguards, there were none on a late Sunday afternoon. He had a long telephoto lense and was filming cameras in high positions on the SEAL beach and filming all the ships and installations along the strand at Coronado. I asked him, who gave him permission to take all these photos. He said, it's a free country and didn't need any permission. He was of military age, probably an officer and somewhat educated, but looked like he was a soldier. Later I called the officer of the day who said it's a free country and that guy has a right to be there. You as an American, cannot of 1 square inch of Chinese land but CCP proxies with cash from Xi Jinping have overbid all the choice residential look and in southern California all the choice farm land and not jus southern California, but from the imperial valley and San Diego all the way to the Canadian border from the coast inland 100 miles and all resort towns and major cities. CCP has taken over Hilton , Campbell's soup, Knott's Berry jam, burger king, 7/11. Not to mention All the military equipment given away by Joe in Kandahar and all the information given to them by Milley and others at the top of our military. I haven't even talked about COVID or the next gem CCP is planning to unleash on Americans. Not to mention tick Tok, temu, CCP police stations, the buying of nation news companies to control the narrative. How often do you here the words Xi Jinping or George or Alexander Soros mentioned in their true context as a cause and source of many of our national problems.
