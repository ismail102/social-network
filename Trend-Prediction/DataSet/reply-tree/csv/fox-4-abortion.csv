586,"Good article. 

Ive never met a woman who had an abortion who didn’t also suffer deep mental distress for the rest of their life. 

In fact, I theorize one reason why some women abortion activists become so radicalized and outspoken is because the only way for women to justify the morality of having an abortion to themselves is the fact that it is legal. 

Legalized abortion is tantamount to society giving women a moral pass to commit murder. 

If abortion were not legal, they would have to face the cold hard fact that it is indeed murder. 

Legal or not the thought of murdering their own baby makes most women suffer terribly for life. 

More research is needed to make the public aware of the negative impacts on our society caused as a consequence of the millions of women who suffer mentally after having had an abortion. 

Likewise, women who have abortions desperately need mental health care. 

It is tragic that our society allows these women to suffer in silence without getting them the help that they so desperately need. 

As if it isn’t bad enough that they are subjected to the predatory practices of the Abortion Industrial Complex, which has hoodwinked so many millions of American women into believing that abortion is ok in the first place.","7 Jan, 2024 09:25 AM",TDG4You!,587,2024-01-07 09:25:00,0 days 02:12:00

You are against abortion because it hurts- it should hurt, really, really badly. You barely touch on the emotional damage, which could be eliminated with the use of the resources you give less time to than your pain. Abortion is murder, murdering your child will at some point cause emotional trauma and hopefully spiritual trauma when you come to faith. God will forgive and a mother can repent, change her lifestyle and heal. God will open His arms to all these mothers and participatory fathers if they come to Him in humility and seeking forgivness. The babies are already safe with God, He loved them at conception. ","7 Jan, 2024 11:45 AM",Americaalltheway085,154,2024-01-07 11:45:00,0 days 04:32:00

I am a follower of Jesus Christ, and I want to tell you I am sorry for all of the hate exhibited in many of the comments on your article.  It is heartbreaking and uncalled for.

While I have no idea as to your personal faith, I want to assure you that the Lord and Savior I know - Jesus - does not condemn you.  I can only imagine the ache you carry with you in your soul following the abortions.  Jesus can heal that.  He is willing to forgive if you sincerely ask for His forgiveness.

I do not pass judgement on you, nor do I condemn you.  What good would judgement or condemnation do?  What good would spitting hurtful words at you do?  None.  Absolutely none.

You were created by God - on purpose, and for a good purpose!  He also created your four children, on purpose, and for a good purpose.  While they are not here physically, I know without a shadow of a doubt, that their souls and spirits are alive, and with Jesus this very moment!  He is the Rock of Ages, and He loves YOU - no matter what you have done, or failed to do.

I will be praying for that ache to be healed, and I applaud your work now to oppose abortion.  

If you do not know Jesus, I pray that you will pick up the Bible and learn about Him.  He and He alone can fill that void in all of us that needs filling.

You are loved.  Thank you for so bravely sharing your story.  Once again, I am so sorry for all of the hate.  We are better than that.  Each of us fights wars that no one else (but Jesus!) understands.  It costs nothing to be kind, and I hope kindness is what I have shown you through my words today.  ♥️","7 Jan, 2024 12:31 PM",sunlight81,380,2024-01-07 12:31:00,0 days 05:18:00

=====
Whether a woman will grieve her abortion for life or not depends upon her spiritual makeup as a human being and woman. Some do and some don't, which reveals, to them at least, to what degree they value human life as such.
There is a correlation between a woman's valuation of her own life and the life of her unborn child, the greater the first the greater the latter, and vice versa.
That valuation depends on their inner nature, spiritually, and their intellectual understanding. The latter is largely dependent on how they were raised as children and youth, what moral understanding they were given.
Sadly, in America most people no longer have a solid moral foundation based on understanding given when they were young, because their parents weren't brought up with much understanding either.","7 Jan, 2024 02:23 PM",conversationswithanonymous,409,2024-01-07 14:23:00,0 days 07:10:00
