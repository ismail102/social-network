Security Council twice voted 13 for, one abstain, and US vetoed the cease fire in Gaza.
In the general assembly 153 countries voted for a cease fire, with ten against including Israel and the US.
The world overwhelmingly was against the US on this. Unhindered support of Israel was making the US look like hypocrites in the world, and creating lots of enemies for us. 
UN has been saying for a week now that 50% of Gazans are starving and 100% are not getting food everyday. 
More than 50% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed.
Three-fourths of their hospitals are out of service when they need them the most.
More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, and 70% of the dead in Gaza are children and women. 
Analysis is showing that Israel dropped more than 500 2,000-lb bombs in a very populated area. These bombs have a kill area of more than 40 soccer fields.
Many Republicans say us supporting Ukraine is creating a security issue for us. But it is not as the whole world is against Russia invading Ukraine.

Sources told the Palestinian Quds News Network that the Al-Qassam ambush targeted the Ukrainian mercenaries after spotting them on Hassanein Street in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood in the Strip.
The occupation army did not include the dead among the numbers it recognized regarding its losses among soldiers in Gaza, according to the sources.
The ambush killed another number of the Zionist occupation army soldiers, the sources stated, indicating that the video that circulated of the mercenary unit in Al-Shujaiya school was recorded on the same day of the targeting.
The circulated footage showed a soldier writing in the Ukrainian language on the blackboard of one of the schools that the occupation forces stormed.","22 Dec, 2023 05:13 PM",3rdMarDiv67-68,686,2023-12-22 17:13:00,0 days 05:48:00
