0,"It is so easy to fix this problem. There's a fast fix and a slow fix. The fast fix is to eliminate the guaranteed student loan program. This will force higher learning to compete for customers, aka students. Many institutions will not make it. The slow fix is to identify institutions that demonstrate freedom and send your kids there. Again, this will force institutions to compete for customers, but it will take more time to see results. Higher education is a business, not unlike Bud Light. Treat it accordingly if you want to make a point.","5 Dec, 2023 05:50 AM",O's,1,2023-12-05 05:50:00,0 days 01:30:00
