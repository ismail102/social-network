539,"Mail In Ballots and early voting with no ID are not in the Constitution.
Absentee voting provisions were first added to the constitution in 1864 (Article XIII of the Amendments to the 1818 Constitution) to allow Civil War soldiers to vote by absentee ballot. The General Assembly first attempted to accomplish this objective through legislation in 1862, but the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional (Opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court, 30 Conn. 591, 1862 WL 941 (Conn.)), thus necessitating a constitutional amendment. The amendment was effective only for the duration of the war.
After the war, absentee voting was not addressed in the constitution until 1932, through Article XXXIX of the Amendments to the 1818 Constitution. (In 1918 the legislature passed a temporary absentee voting law for World War I soldiers.) The 1932 amendment allowed the General Assembly to enact legislation establishing absentee voting privileges for individuals who could not appear at the polls because of absence from their city or town, sickness, or physical disability. In 1964, the privilege was extended to include individuals whose religion forbids secular activity on the day of an election (Article XII of the Amendments to the 1955 Constitution). These provisions are now codified in Article VI, Section Seven of the current constitution. Legislation authorizing the use of absentee ballots is codified at CGS ¬ß 9-135.

Eventually the pendulum will swing the other way and despite previous efforts of the opposite to prevent this the other party gains control and understandably want to undo the previous obstacles placed by the other party.
A more Libertarian platform limiting big Federal Government over reach and a return to our truly constitutional basis of EVERY power not specifically granted to the Federal Government is an individual state authority would remove the massive motivation for either party to control Congress.  
The less authority the Federal Government is allowed the less power advantages either party can wield. I don‚Äôt see any other practical way of removing that incentive.
