"Welcome back, worst president ever, according to several surveys of presidential historians.
A million more Americans died under you than died in four years under any previous president."
Very Different Rules

You�re irrelevant. No one cares.
I am writing from Venezuela because of the situation in our country. My name is Hugo Ron. I have a family of ten people. A monthly salary of $8 dollars per month is my e-mail address: Hugoron280@gmail.com.
He�s back 
HES BACK BOYS!
Send 
 he seems to have been accepted as part of the Fam with coins and special handshakes!
"No one wants you at the inauguration.

Literally no one."
Good. Don�t legitimize an illegitimate president. Don�t reward cheaters like Joe!
"Nobody wanted or expected your petty ass to show up. But it just shows how hollow your hostage video message was last night.

You don't care about uniting the country. You just tried to burn it all down because you're a crybaby loser terrorist."
Disgraceful

@mrp
"NOBODY ASKED YOU BITCH.
FOH."
Good. It�s illegitimate anyways.

"I guess this is for the best after everything but, as someone who has supported you for four years, I think you should attend. Hillary Clinton attended yours. This is what makes America exceptional. That we have this symbolism of a peaceful transition of power."
I wouldn�t go either!
YES!!!! WINNING!!!! BYEEEEEE!!!!
Shouldn�t have allowed an election to be stolen and this would have never happened
"We know that, because you could go to jail, moron."
GOOD!
Loser
You can tell the quality of a man by how well they lose.
"You could just leave Washington now, that would be fine

See ya"
Stay classy San Diego

You will be going to the Impeachment though
"To all of those who have asked, I will not be attending the wedding of my ex girlfriend who I constantly cheated on and is now marrying the type of intelligent, kind man she should have been with in the first place."
The 17 rings of sadness biden will have setup are all taken by paid actors and staff members. It was all a hoax from day 1.

Was he invited though?
Klan meeting that day?
"Thank You, Mr President."
Thank god
"Sir, thank you! It would have been super awkward."
"No one needs you there.

That inauguration is a gathering of decent people and lovers of democracy. 

You aren't qualified."
Or any other future inauguration.

@realDonaldTrump
Because you�ll be going directly to Rikers in handcuffs
"Yes, because that would require a modicum of class that you don't possess."
Of course not. It would take grace and confidence and a love of country to attend. You have none of those things.
Ahahahahaha
Good. Insurrectionists need not apply.

"Just remember check out is at noon, you can leave the key under the mat"
"No one cares, Loser"
Just resign.
"Highly doubtful that you'd pass vetting to get in, to be honest."
Busy moving that day pal?

"Wait, who are you again?"
I understand. My daughter�s kindergarten class won�t let them take off for the inauguration either. Ask Melania to write you a note!
You are everything that I am teaching my daughter NOT to be.  Life isn�t about losing or winning. Life is about having the right people in place to move forward with peace and kindness.
What about Barry from EastEnders? Is he going?
You could help to unite our country- but no one expects you to do anything for anyone other than yourself. Go away
You'll be busy fleeing to Russia?
Cool. This announcement should help speed the impeachment proceedings.
Good riddance.
"Stay classy, cheater."
Good!! No one wants a seditious traitor who led a violent coup to destroy our democracy at the event. Only ones invited are those who believe in our constitution. No MAGA terrorists welcome!!
By all who asked I�m sure he means federal prosecutors who want to keep track of trumps movements
They probably told you it was on the 21st
No one cares or wants you there.

"Looks like the tantrum-y toddler in the Oval has grown up to be the sore loser who storms off the Little League field refusing to shake hands with the winning team

Sounds about right... I sure am glad America won�t have to endure his teen years in the White House!"

 LMFAOOOOOO RT 
 The way you weren�t invited.... RT 
" To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th."
"good. go away, peppermint petty."
Will 
 even be there?
No one asked.
You are the worlds most pathetic loser. You have never shown class once your entire presidency and will exit with less class than anyone had ever imagined. You�re a man without a country and had so many opportunities to change that.
