 Eternity clause 

You are right about the referenced article is about not chaning the fundamental principles of democracy. And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman. He does not want the word """"democracy"""". He then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all (international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constition"""" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" and again was wrongfully pushing the word """"constitution"""" (which Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which it was. And it was not a personal essay on a statue, but a very important contribution regarding democracy in Germany based on the law.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

A matter of fact

In 1987 The New Yorker magazine published an article written by Alec Wilkinson concerning one Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, a 23 years of age individual who would sit out in Greenwich Village and offer passersby Free Advice. In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: """"...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do..."""". Nowhere, not on Oprah, not on CNN, or anywhere else, did these three persons inform the public that they were making their fame at the expense of someone else's idea.

Reviewing your sources.... """"MSM in Africa"""" does not contain the string """"trans"""" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that """"TG is typically considered alongside"""".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: """"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."""" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as """"MSM"""" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as """"MSTGW"""" and not """"MSM"""" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: """"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as """"balls."""" These social networks include """"houses"""" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000). All four also were commercial sex workers.""""  This is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.
My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

154,"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

163,"""::::::::Hungarian and some British sources from the late 19th and early 20th centuries used the spelling """"Rumania"""" (with a """"u"""") to describe """"Romania"""". The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century? 

Likewise, the term """"Palestine"""" for the """"holyland"""" was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus. 

If I were to replace """"Israel"""" with """"Palestine"""" that would have not only been an anachronism (for 4,000 years ago it was not known as Israel), but it would also be a politically inclined decision (although in even more ancient history books, like, say, the bible, the term """"Israel"""" is widely used to describe parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian Authority). You're hiding behind a supposable academic and scientific argument to instill your narrative, which I have no doubt seems very academic and scientific to you. Whereas I was merely suggesting to use a very dry and neutral definition - The area which is currently known as Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Please refrain from projecting your political views with the word """"Palestine"""" into this article on a foodstuff. It's highly inappropriate. Thank you.

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

I'm also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor.  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate, and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to?

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0

That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your """"proof"""" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own """"proof"""" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154

260,"""The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:
1) Harding's alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.

2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).

3) Harding was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.

4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   

5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.

6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth.

If Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.

Now a series of utter morons have taken it upon themselves to revert my work for no reason whatsoever.  I'd ask them to explain themselves here but they have no possible explanation for what they are doing, so I just put this here to note how some people of appallingly limited intellectual ability are here not to build an encyclopaedia but simply to play some kind of bizarre game.  186.9.130.243  

Pretty hilarious that one of these sick idiots says to discuss things on talk while going around removing everything I post on talk pages.  Seriously, what a fucking child.  Pathetic.  186.9.134.92",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0

For 4 of the 13 (Donduseni, Drochia, Dubasari and Edinet) I did also a little bit more: I looked into the 1930 map and 1930 tables, and I have identified the former names. (A few current hamlets do not appear in 1930, so those have no former names.) This is a very interesting process and I kind of like it (I like reading maps), but it is too much time consuming, so I guess I won't do this now for the rest. (Will do it sometimes later.) 
Also, perhaps I shouldn't fill in now more data as I did for Drochia district (I did it there mostly because I wanted to have one-two districts done well.) I am afraid if I don't get to the bottom of the 32... 19 is still a large number... \talk",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

""""Another favored technique of lobbyists is the doctoring of Wikipedia, a site that is widely loathed in the industry for its phenomenal reach and for the fact that a tiny community of editors is able to decide whether a corporation has a """"controversies"""" section on their wiki or not. “A ridiculous organization... created by a bunch of nerds,” is Tim Bell’s take on the site. Accounts associated with Bell Pottinger were caught scrubbing the profiles of, among many others, the arms manufacturer and client the Paramount Group, at least two large financial firms, and the founder of libel specialists Carter-Ruck.

“It's important for Wikipedia to recognize we are a valuable source for accurate information,” Bell told PR Week.

I've seen this in action on living politicians - for example a statement of fact that they are employing their spouse on public money being censored out.

To the point in hand there is ample and remarkable coverage of this man being 'most hated' in respectable printed newspapers - so put a paragraph on this phenomena.....there's actually a refusal to claim he was criticized on social media on this talk page even though a presidential candidate (h Clinton) posted on twitter in relation to it......actually *rejecting* that social media reacted to this individuals actions as it demonstrably did. No room for truth or reality on Wikipedia when it comes to living corporate figures or politicians - even when the material is making news headlines.

He and a few others at the Sikh-History.com are bent on propagating their views without any backing from SGGS or other recorded evidence. A lot of the Sikh history is being twisted by these people at their site. They will go to any lengths to promote their views. For example, the Sakhi of Guru Gobind Singh and Madho Das (Banda Bahadar) has been twisted without any credible historical records been quoted or researched.

Unfortunately, I do not at present have the time to deal with these people but I think that their approach of promoting their views under the Sikhism banner is deplorable and needs to be restrained. All the views promoted by Sikhs must have a credible backing from SGGS or other renowned scholars like Bhai Gurdas and we must be able to check these references  or translation. These people have at one point said that 4 translations of SGGS are wrong and their views are correct. I appreciate your concern and you have my support in dealing with this problem.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajalt",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

However, in the interests of mutual understanding, permit me to clarify a few things. Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity (I cannot speak for Islam). And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity. And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them, but again this is only true of a small segment.

 Terms not concepts 
I think at some point I saw in my watchlist a comment from someone about some kind of term not being a concept. I was puzzled at the time, and now today you have reverted the inclusion of a terms category in a concepts category. (I am wondering if that was you not too long ago). I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be """"thought of""""). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many """"terminology"""" categories, and I basically see them as """"junk"""" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from """"terminology"""" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of """"concepts"""".

Should The Great Khali be on ON Air Talent because right now, he has just been a bodyguard for Daivari and hasnt wrestled yet.

idk if anyone has mentioned him, but isnt Marty Jannetty supposed to appear on the ECW brand(hes inactive now)? i know there were rumors saying he was released shortly after being signed, but he said they were untrue and WWE hasnt officially cut ties with him, at least publicly.

And if Jannetty is left off, then i think Gangrel should be true. rumors said he was overweight and WWE was considering not using him

Angel Williams has been called up to valet the Gymini. she did so for a dark match, should she be called up to SD! yet?

Your problems here began with the improper and unsourced edits you made to the bio of Andrei Treivas Bregman (alias Michael Lucas), at the behest of Lucas.

An anonymous editor suggested that you had done this in exchange for sexual favors from Lucas  it had nothing to do with any foreign trips you made. With these edits, you reversed your earlier edits and contradicted your earlier statements regarding the content  content you eventually changed for Lucas. Later, you engaged in a prolonged exchange with another editor over the inclusion of """"Bregman"""" in Lucas's real name. Despite the fact that Bregman is reliably sourced, you removed it like Lucas wanted. Most recently you became embroiled in conflict over the use of your Farrell picture; no need to go into detail about that.

 Regarding Joseph E Prince 
Please explain why you deleted this page - this is a verifiable story at imdb.com under Liberation Saturday   

I deleted Joseph E Prince under WP:CSD#A7, because it listed a person who was a high school and college athlete but did not participate at any professional level. These did not seem to be assertions of notability to me. In re-reading the deleted article, I do see that there was an assertion: He is most noted for 2008 short documentary Liberation Saturday... which technically disqualifies this article for speedy deletion. That doesn't mean the subject is notable, but if you wish me to restore it I will do so. You may reasonably expect someone else to nominate it for deletion, however; being the subject of a documentary is not generally considered to confer notability. (Note that the film does not have an article either.) When you recreated the article two days later and a different admin deleted it, the same A7 reason was given, and that deletion was correct, as it did not even assert notability. Another option is for me to restore the article to your own user space so you can work on it and get advice from others before moving it to the main article space.    talk  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Kwami puts it perfectly. Mr Anderson, who has been site-banned for a week (again), is making this a WP:POINTY part of his campaign to reduce the style guides to ... well ... nothing. He has, actually, done us a service in raising matters to do with the relationship between the MoS and external sources, and between the MoS and WP:TITLE. But I believe he should give his campaign a rest; it is highly disruptive and we all have better things to do.Yes, dashes vs hyphens carry important meanings for readers, and are a long-established part of the language. It is yet more important since readers see our text on electronic monitors; often, they are not of the best resolution, and no one sees it as well as on paper in good light. Hyphens can look like dots or smudges in many circumstances. This might be OK for when a hyphen is correct, but when a dash is prescribed by many of the most prestigious authorities in the US, the UK and elswhere, it is professional to use it.This debate needs to be at MoS talk, not here.

 You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war  according to the reverts you have made on Srebrenica massacre. Users who edit disruptively or refuse to collaborate with others may be blocked if they continue. In particular the three-revert rule states that making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24-hour period is almost always grounds for an immediate block. If you find yourself in an editing dispute, use the talk page to discuss controversial changes. Work towards wording and content that gains consensus among editors. If unsuccessful, then do not edit war even if you believe you are right. Post a request for help at an appropriate noticeboard or seek dispute resolution. In some cases it may be appropriate to request temporary page protection. If edit warring continues, you may be blocked from editing without further notice. 

 Please do not attack other editors, as you did at Srebrenica massacre. Comment on content, not on contributors. Personal attacks damage the community and deter users. Please stay cool and keep this in mind while editing. Thank you.   (TALK)

The only ntl event I have not seen the full draw for  in '69 is Laver's win at Orlando over Rosewall. I saw your link to the warehouse talk and I am very pleased that someone has tracked down this extra match at the Dutch round robin. I use to think this was a 4 man rr, but found out it was 8 man with 2 groups of 4 earlier this year. There were some upsets at this event with Ralston  beating Rosewall on clay.  On the 1963 results I am slightly suspicious of Laver winning twice by the same score 6-0, 6-3 at MSG; once in the 6 man phase and once in the final play-off phase.

Another reason perhaps wanting to limit amount of links on page - however 2 links is not excessive surely? Perhaps the most likely reason is that I posted the link myself for a website I own. Can it be verified who posted the link for derilicte.co.uk then. The users have blocked their details from inspection with Nominet so it could well be posted by a user who edits the RAF Rudloe Manor pages. If we discover who runs this site and they are on the Rudloe Manor page should this be deleted also?

Thank you Rklawton. User Verbal chose on another page """"crop circles"""" to delete my link to my website there also. However Verbal did not bother to check the other links, some of which link to conetnt which requires plugin software to be installed. This is discouraged by Wiki policy external links but for some reason Verbal chose to only take a keen interest in removing my link and not bothering checking anything else or doing any other work. I find this odd and Verbal has followed me on to this page to decry my links. The words Witch Hunt come to mind. Can you please explain what reasons you feel apply to why the links need to be removed? If it would make you happier I could easily provide another wesbite which is not owned by myself but uses my aerial photos of Rudloe Manor.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither.

 Re: Coca-Cola 

Sorry if I rudely didn't drop an explanatory note at your talk page; it was rude of me and poor behavior.

Please see our Manual of Style to understand the correct formatting and appearance standards. The one issue with your additions is that the captions for the images are entirely too long and full of extraneous information; image captions are not museum display cards and do not serve to detail every single item appearing in the image; Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a museum. They should also never state """"note the x"""" or other similar attention drawing text, per WP:W2W, one of our guidelines on writing prose. They also had inappropriate use of capitalization, boldface and other formatting issues. For example, ALLCAPS spelling is never used for emphasis, as it is read as shouting on the Internet. 

As for the Coca-Cola additions, I took them out for lack of relevance. The Coca-Cola article is about the drink, not the company; that's at The Coca-Cola Company. The information in those images is better placed there, but in the article text, not the image caption.

The other reversions were based on similar concerns; the same sort of formatting and caption length issues were present there. In the one article, for example, the caption was nearly as long as the rest of the text in the article, when that text should really go in the article's body text instead. 

Once again, my apologies for biting your head off, as you were editting in good faith. I hope that my poor behavior doesn't turn you off to the collabrative process and that, with a bit of polishing, you can add much to our growing base of knowledge.

Five of the statements are simply wrong. Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on """"Atonement and Eucharist"""" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don't have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

Since the subject of links has been broached, I wonder if it wouldn't be good to try to resolve that category next, rather than item by item. A cross-wiki link to Wiktionary may be better for some of the links, but for now, I'd like to focus on only the issue of whether the word should be linked or not. 
What should not be linked Plain English words:
crocodile
universe
mortality
theistic 
The time, space, causation, change and eternity articles do include sections on philosophy, but it is embarrassing that the only comment on Asian thought on these matters I found was one sentence in Causality. Consequently, a reader of this article would find little of help in those. Moreover, this article does not discuss the philosophy of time, space, causation, change or eternity in any significant detail. But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality.
time
space
causation
change
eternity

What should be linked Major connections with the subject of another article that will help readers to understand the current article more fully:
Vishwanath
Kashi
Shiva
Ishwara
Manisha Panchakam But only if the article is written promptly.
Nrsimha
Kali
Laksmi 
Buddhism
South India Kashmir is linked, so South India or India should be linked as well (but only the first occurrence). The second is a redlink.

Technical terms should be linked unless they are fully defined in the article:
shlokas
atman But only the first occurrence and it should be spelled consistently.

PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS !

No academic research , conducted in Turkish Republic, ever denies the fact that """"MANY"""" Armenians were killed during the relocation but """"A MILLION"""" IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE.

I'm ambivalent on this particular issue. On one hand, the content doesn't convey direct information on Muhammad and is therefore not essential to the article. Consensus matters, and clearly there isn't consensus on including this image, and so it should be out. On the other hand, I'm strongly offended by the view of some Muslim editors here that Wikipedia should in any way adjust its presentation to be """"Islamic"""". While Islamic law may prohibit Muslims from depicting Muhammad, non-Muslims shouldn't be pressed to follow Islamic customs. Naturality in the spirit of civility, even non-Muslims shouldn't engage in presenting works or content that denegrate Muslims or Islamic customs. This image however does not seem to be intended to denegrate Muhammad or Islam in any way, and therefore it's unreasonable for Muslims here to be so agitated by such images. The image shouldn't be included, in the end, since there isn't consensus. I'm not happy with the idea of giving into fundementalist muslim mentality though.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Irrelevant sociologists?

Nor does it mean that races are not social constructs as is the prevailing view among anthropologists and social scientists, because the particular genetic differences that correspond to races only become salient when racial categories take on social importance. From this sociological perspective, Edwards and Lewontin are therefore both correct.""""

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this.

 IPA - what 

I read the main page of the article on IPA.
On the plus side it is clear.
On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)
Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.
My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):
An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?

Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?
Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: """"if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}""""""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

790,"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I really don't care all that much about the Jewish lists and categories.  I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes """"keep"""" for anything with the word """"Jewish"""" in it; nor am I an editor who votes """"delete"""" whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).

I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a """"criteria for speedy deletion"""" that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.

But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating """"Jewish Foo"""" lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted """"delete"""" on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.

There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.

If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.  Your start so far has not been portentious; but you certainly have time left to learn, and to make amends.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work.

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES.

Failed verification
Pressure

A source is being mis-used where there is a statement that says the fringe media pressured these various agencies to respond.   

Entry says:Because of the popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many enquiries from people demanding an explanation.[1][3]

I think it is dubious and the source does not mention popularity as the cause for this pressure nor do these vague inquires seem to be specific incident complaints of the type these agencies investigate. This would require times, dates, locations, to proof of an incident much less any """"suspect"""" worthy of investigation by the responding agencies.  One caveat is that these are alleged to be CBW issues and an environmental agency, space agency, or weather agency, or FAA would not even be the primary agency to respond, In my opinion, they might be notified or have something forwarded to them if only to answer questions that they might receive.  After enough questions they made fact sheets.  Were the fact sheets released solely because the theory is popular or because of the exasperating questions?  It should worded better. example below:.  Not sure what the dead link said. It's not verifiable.

Good try, guys, but this United Kingdom wikipedia club is not quite reaching quality levels of communicaton.  Jza84 and ddstretch both say they agree with Snowded, but what do they agree about?

If what I wrote is not clear (if that is what you agree with), I will restate it, but please specify what I need to clarify.  It seems obvious that the four constitutent parts are getting more than their fair share of the attention in this article. The article already states (with a citation) that the four parts are not official divisions ('""""should not be considered as first-order administrative divisions""""').  Then it says that, historically, other divisions (county, parish, not to mention districts that succeeded the ecclesiastical districts, then ward and constituency) have been the subnational divisions.  It is anybody’s guess whether he latter are official divisions, relatively more official divisions than the vernacular ones of the 4 countries, or co-existing divisions with the 4 countries in the multiplistic complex arrangement that is the UK.  Moreover, despite the statement that there is """"no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom"""", the structure of 4 (Scotland, England, NI, and Wales) is used as just such a common stratum to describe local government and to structure the article.

You, a writer, must know the basic of vocabulary in order to write. Talk by definition is seen in the following example: I go on your article under edit write Oh! this is a great article you must read it, Blah, Blah, Blah, ect. Vandalism is malicious, willfully destruction of public, or personal property, such as windows of a building, or a historical document, not an article. But, if you want to stretch the word to cover your criminal article(an article whose intent is to past along only half the story, which is half the truth, which is a lie, which is given to deceive and to harm individuals reading the article hoping to be FULLY informed, Not half informed, this is seen by you trying to hide the truth that stays in the framework (intent and purpose) of the article, and completes the article. This is a criminal act of fraud, and the damage done to people's personal property, i.e. their computers, is the criminal act of vandalism. All is done through, and by, your article by hiding the truth, and giving only half the story that does not stay in the intent and purpose of the article, i.e. to fully inform the public of the versions of Firefox)this then would be the example I write in your article that it is crap, bogus. that people should not read it. Blah, Blah, Blah, ect. Neither of these did I do. All I did was complete the article within it's framework giving the full truth. Some the people that you are are hurting are low income, especially the elderly, whose only escape from drudgery and pain of their life is either the TV or computer. These people cannot afford computer tech to service their computers, they have to """"rely on the kindness of strangers"""", such as volunteers such as myself. Some do not have a network of tech volunteers, so your article causes them suffering by hiding the truth from them (by removal of any information that shows the serious flaws of those versions so that it is never seen and the people are not informed), and by not having the money, or the means to correct it, and taking what little pleasure and escape from them. For this act the courts should pass the harshest and heaviest sentence possible on you, and others like you. I hope in the near future that not only that you are arrested, tried, and imprisoned, but you are sued and lose everything you have, everything you have striven for, and everything you have dreamed about. So, that when you come out of prison all you will have, or will ever have is the clothes on your back and that's all.

 Objectivity of Circumcision article should be flagged due to Gilgal Fellows on salary who patrol & edit the article 

As a matter of curiosity

As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, """"Global Trends,"""" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia? ... Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. Joe Circus (talk) 

    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail. Garycompugeek (talk) 

        Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission. It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS. Joe Circus (talk) 

            No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP. Joe Circus (talk) 

                It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal. If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability. Jakew (talk) 

                    """"...we can assess..."""" Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows? Joe Circus (talk) 

                        """"We"""" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. Jakew (talk) 

                            All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the """"consensus"""" is already fixed in advance, what's the point? Joe Circus (talk) 

                                Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic. It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.
                                As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a """"circumcision fetish""""; searching Google Scholar for """"Gilgal Society"""" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either. So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. Jakew (talk) 

                                    """"Our"""" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows? I'm not certain WHO you're representing here. Joe Circus (talk) 

                                        Wikipedia's policies, obviously. Jakew (talk) 

                                            Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will. It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence. One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page. If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

I agree, but I also don't agree.  There is nothing incorrect about the way that the article present Cruz's position.

You want to quote a reporter for CBS News, when that reporter is covering Cruz's appearance on Jay Leno's show.  The article currently quotes Cruz directly on what he said on Leno's show.  That option trumps the quoting of a reporter who wrote what he wanted to write and not what Cruz said.

Drmies you are full of shit. As has been pointed out to you, you should not be blocking where you are involved. But rest assured I consider it an honor to be blocked by you. I am sure that you believe you are an honest decent fellow. Some of the worst liars begin with lies to themselves. I stand by all of my comments. They are true and accurate. The abuse I described is 100% accurate and far from me needing to be blocked the editors attacking me should be, but it will never happen. I don't sweat it, but I'm not going to stay silen about the abuse. Dishonest, bullying and harasment are not okay. The abusive history and the NUMEROUS accusations of bad faith against me speak for themselves. I have been absolutely transparent about my reasoning and motives and I am very happy with the work I've done here. I am most proud that I have stood up against some of the worst admin abuse, dishonest and harassment by POV pushers like Drmies and other dishonest characters that abuse Wikipedia to advance their personal point of view and gang up on people they disagree with me. Your ridiculous """"associate professor is no more notable than a professor"""" commentary is a perfect example. You want to be held in high esteem and to be highly respected. But respect is earned Drmies and there is very little about your behavior or how you treat others that merits respect. You should stop drinking so much and reflect on who you are as a person.

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,

1. The statement that “Jehovah's Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole” is grossly misleading because all Jehovah’s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do. Hence this statement of yours misrepresents. 

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole.

Controversy or not
Reading the article about the existence of a """"controversy"""" seems that there is not any controversy at all and instead the few not supporting human-causation in rising temperatures are outliers.

If this is the case the article seems to be unnecessary entirely.  If it is not the case then the article's balance is not to Wikipedia's standards.

Dual philosophies used in enforcement of policies, guidelines and content.
Questions seem to persists relating to the validity of sources.  On one hand sources that are not in agreement with the """"global warming conseneus"""" viewpoint are removed with the related text.  On the other hand sources that are in agreement with the """"global warming consensus"""" viewpoint are replaced.

Questions persists relating to the Wikipedia standards for handling edits.
When edits are made that are about one side of the Global Warming Controversy they are deleted or reverted with little, if any explanation.  When edits are made about the other side of the Global Warming Controversy there are attempts to """"make them better"""" instead of deletions. """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

That thing you did
‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’
Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 changing geo-stub 

this is bordering on the absurd.  I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with Oceania-geo-stub, and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an Oceania-geo-stub.  07:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the Stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? 
I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands.  I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...)   07:46, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello? 
Ah.  I will look into it.  Tokelau has always been something of a side-bar interest for me, since they seem to be the """"left-out"""" islands.  I'll check out what you've written, and add anything that I think I might have to contribute.  Unfortunately for my ability to contribute to these Polynesia-related articles, Wikipedia is catching me about 15 years after my interest in the subject reached its zenith...  I ardently believe in the philosophy that drives Wikipedia, and so I'm doing whatever I can to write, edit or create appropriate articles, based mostly on memory (which is why they seem sometimes perhaps to be a bit light on citation...)...If I had a crappier memory, I'd be more hesitant about contributing... -)  Believe me tho...when I decided to move to the Marquesas, specifically, to Eïao, my decision was well-researched.

When you edit pages:

 Please respect others' copyrights; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly.
 Please use a neutral point of view when editing articles; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
 If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to do so. 
 Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Adding such content or editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism.

The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. For now, if you are stuck, you can click the edit this page tab above, type {{helpme}} in the edit box, and then click Save Page; an experienced Wikipedian will be around shortly to answer any questions you may have. Also feel free to ask a question on . I will answer your questions as far as I can! Thank you again for contributing to Wikipedia.

Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:

In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design. 
 
This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

First of all, you don't know crap about Vietnam.

Secondly, of course many (actual) rebels were local residents, i.e. of KBR. But as of the bodies, some/most of them belonged to innocent civilians who were killed in crossfire (like even the KBR president said). Here's about the mechanism of this:

""""This is a commonplace in Chechnya. I have not been to Nalchik and I do not know this case, but it is quite possible that such things happen there too. Well, basically, they happen throughout entire Russia, only specifics are different — drugs or weapons are planted in order to jail one or get paid for closing a case,"""" an officer of the Department for the Combating of Organised Crime and Terrorism of the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry told Caucasian Knot's correspondent. """"Of course, civilians sometimes die in Chechnya and in other North Caucasus republics, too, where counter-terrorist activities are conducted, and weapons are planted on them by officers that are not the most conscientious. But one should understand that they do so not because they want to register another victory for themselves, but for fear that they can be jailed for good because of this accidental killing."""" According to the officer, one should not say that """"someone is killed on purpose and then registered as a rebel. Only Kadyrovtsy do so. It is not a custom among us, federals.""""

And actually indeed some time later a group of Kadyrov's policemen (called """"a gang"""") were persecuted precisely for this, that is killing random people (few men and a woman they kidnapped and killed) and then planting guns and explosives on them for promotions. But of course, there was also the case of Vladimir Glebov, etc.

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.  Thus when I spot an inconsitency in their pieces and add some correct and especially logical words to their precious piece they get their knickers in a twist and childishly erase my effort and thus leave all other Wiki readers just as ignorant as they themselves.

I don't know whether the Opus Dei adheres to the index or, as it is said, censures new books, but I may say that if, it wouldn't be to blame for it. It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?) 84.154.109.57

In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).

 Metacompiler 

Hay I see you contributed to compiler-compiler and to the metacompiler page adding a CWIC topic

It seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles it's self I.E.

Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

A common saying on FORTH sites. Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as Forth does.

Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of the Language Development Group at Kontron electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended PASCAL. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In Circuit Emulators supported. Actually I started with FutureData that was bought be GenRad and then sold to Kontron.

A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language.
 
Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [Sci-Tech Dictionary McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.""""

We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature:

""""The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" 
Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what.

The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.

There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like BOOK1, BOOK2, and CWIC are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was:

""""A compiler-building system developed by Brooker and Morris"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"BNF"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage.

CWIC was based partly on Schorre's META compilers and partly on LISP2 developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from TREE META. Is unclear of Schorre worked on TREE META. Thhe Stanford Research paper does not list Schorre. 

I implemented an extended CWIC compiler compiler on a DEC-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the CWIC generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in CWIC documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has EVAL calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables.

I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.

Val Schorre submitted papers in the SegForth ACM group in the 80s. Val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced).

It is Nanking and Peking, not Pakking and Namking because you are confusing these early romanisations with the Jyut Ping which is a later linguistic invention. They are also not all romanised according to English. The British invaders came the last. They were first romanised by an Italian Missionary called Ricci and then by the French missionaries. That is why Guangdong is written as Canton. Canton was never meant to be an English romanisation. If you pronounce it in French, it sound exactly like the Cantonese pronunciation of it, even today. Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass.

Therefore, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hahn is full of shit. Lane splitting is NOT a """"grey area."""" It is LEGAL, as described by the California Department of Motor Vehicles HERE 

http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk//shr_slow_veh.htm

""""Motorcycles may travel faster than traffic during congested road conditions and can legally travel in the unused space between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles; this is commonly called """"lane splitting."""" """"

So, how about you just go back and change your sanctimonious little edit back to the truth ? Which is, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hoy is about as ignorant on the subject as Joan Claybrooke ? and his stupid, uninformed, retarded remarks have no place in an encyclopedia ?  

Thank you.

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agains the invaders were regular victims of WAR, not the HOLOCAUST itself.

Good news for you: since all the images at the Spanish wikipedia are placed in commons:. there is no need to cross reference them, you just use them! Just be careful to change Imagen with Image.

A not though on the naming of the articles. Except for provincial capitals, the default convention is to name cities and towns with their name only. If there is an ambiguity (e.i. Carlos Pellegrini is also a former-president), then you add the Province's name after a comma:
Carlos Pellegrini, Santa Fe.

 Airbag Fatalities 

I removed this:

""""In Europe the number of people not wearing their seatbelts is very small when compared to the US, and Europeans are less likely to be obese. As a direct result of these two points, European airbags are less powerful than their American counterparts and are therefore less likely to cause loss of life than those fitted to American cars.""""

Give me a break.  If you want to reintroduce this, please provide citations for every claim made in the paragraph.  

Agreed.  I've heard the exact opposite regarding airbag deployment strength, in factthat American-market cars have less forceful airbags because the occupants are more likely not to be wearing their seat belt, whereas in Europe the airbags can deploy faster (more forcefully) because it's assume you're wearing a seatbelt.   KeplerNiko

With exception to the """"Europeans being less obese"""" bit, I'd probably agree with that first statement - sounds about right to me.  

 Dates of Deployment

I take strong issue with the discussion of the dates of airbags first being used in vehicles, especially since it seems to me that it violates Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.  It seems to me that this article is American-car biased, a country whose automobile manufacturers are most assuredly not first when I think of those who were first-adopters of new safety technology.

Particularly, the line about Chrysler making airbags """"standard equipment across its entire line in 1990"""" makes it sound like Chrysler was the first manufacturer to standardize airbag installation.  The next paragraph indicates, however, that US cars produced after 1 April 1989 must have either airbags or automatic seat belts (latter is news to me)it seems to me that the vast majority of manufacturers opted to install airbags over seat belt systems.  However, the way the article is written, it seems like Chrysler's actions were unique and, most of all, done out of its own initiative, rather than being federally mandated.

Quite simply, Chrysler was neither the only company to take this step, nor did it have a choice in the matter. I think the line implying Chrysler did something innovative should be stricken.   KeplerNiko

1970's Implication
The US experiment in the early 1970's ended pretty quickly as I recall. Does the article mean to imply that this was ongoing?   

Maine.gov Link
Regarding link Maine.gov  How do air bags work:
Link has gone bad. Found replacement link at  but
there is little useful information there. As the link adds nothing to the article, I removed the
link entirely.  

...airbags only reduce fatalities in those wearing seatbelts by 8% 
Following up on an old point by Tekfiler, the government does not want you to know this number, since that would be clear indication of a collossal waste in terms of cost benefit analysis. So - the stat is never called out. The [[NHTSA}} page has some interesting data on how U.S. highway deaths have been declining at a slower rate than in other industrialised nations. If airbags were really all they are cracked up to be, seems that would not be true.  

It is also advised that you dont sit too close to the steering wheel because when the airbag inflates it will crush you back in your seat, stopping you from inhaling cause your crest can't go out, therefore stopping you from breathing.

What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Your request for rollback

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.

I do suggest you stop bothering with the Libertarianism page - they're either grossly-obsessed ideologically-motivated fanatics or they are so incredibly stupid that NOTHING gets through to them. Either way, trying to reason with them is like trying to reason with disobedient children who are suffering from severe ADHD. And while I strongly distrust and dislike most of the left-wing gang, Jrtayloriv is one seriously disturbed individual. Watch your back with him - he has DEEEEEEP emotional issues (look how completely mental he became when I stopped responding to his petty taunts?) And Torchwood Who? is showing distinct signs of being one of Jrtayloriv's sock-puppets (what are the odds of two complete nutters starting to obsess over every detail about my Wiki history in precisely the same way and at precisely the same time?)

Hindutva rose as a complementary movement to Marathi cultural resurgence (all founders were Marathis (specifically Marathas and Konkanastha Brahmins and till 1970's most memebers of RSS were Marathis). Hindutva in these days is a vague ideology. It differs from one propounded by Savarkar to the one practised by 'parties' like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal.

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)

ST's initiative was geared at editor retention, the way I see it. As he mentioned on his Talk page, he prefers facilitating collaboration than meting out discipline.
Unfortunately, there are problems with COI on Wikipedia, etc, and these issues are not all amenable to touchy-feely solutions. 
Although I haven't broached the possibility before, this case provides the opportunity for a hypothetical scenario. Supposing that the Koch brothers, to whommoney is no object, have some funds allocated in their PR efforts that include Wikipedia. Well, such editors are not going to be amenable to reason, because they would be being paid not to be reasonable.

This is NOT the correct definition of queer.  According to the free dictionary dot com, queer is """"Deviating from the expected or normal; strange: a queer situation. 2. Odd or unconventional, as in behavior; eccentric. See Synonyms at strange.""""  And according to Merriam-Webster, queer means """"a  differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal. b (1)  eccentric, unconventional (2)  mildly insane  touched.""""  And according to common sense, queer is not exclusive to """"sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual, heteronormative, or gender-binary
"""" as Wikipedia is defining it.  This whole gay rights zeitgeist is completely out of control.  Wikipedia- you are totally ridiculous and becoming irrelevant with this crap.

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.  The area (often a Latin term) will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. """"East Franks"""" are a folk, """"Germany"""" is an area. """"Lombards"""" are a folk. """"Italy"""" is an area, etc. The """"Kingdom of Germany"""" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).

 Vandalism 

Can someone please correct the vandalism on the introduction? It is clearly very insulting towards Ronaldinho, and is in now way adhering to the guidelines... I can't change, new account. Thanks   

 Move From Barcelona to Milan 

Ronaldinho was moved to Milan for various reasons. Him and Lionel Messi shared a great bond when Mesi was first emergeing at the club, but for some reasons the manger didn't thing he would be good for Messi.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

I have posted my comments indicating that I would be offline after them as a courtesy to others, who might wonder why I haven't replied to them quickly or might not be doing so at all.  Not everyone checks user and talk pages to see courtesy postings about online status, etc.  Sorry that you find my attempt to be courteous to other Wikipedians """"annoying"""".  In the past, you (and others) have not understand my comments (see the archives); as you (and others) seem to mistinterpret what I write and to read intentions in what I write that I do not have, I have suggested that you (and some of these others) not engage in these kinds of exchanges with me; I do not find them productive.
I am replying only out of courtesy and so that eventually this exchange can be archived by the automatic archiving bot.
There is no """"rule"""" or """"guideline"""" in Wikipedia that one must reply to every comment in one's user talk page or an article talk page.  Replying is up to one's own discretion and time constraints (""""schedule""""). There is no requirement that editors must spend their time editing Wikipedia; WP:POL states the opposite; that one should not be criticized for how one chooses to spend one's own time.  That is the prerogative of each of us.  How we express ourselves, as long as it is courteous, is also up to each of us.  If we want to take our time to criticize others, we need to keep in mind that we are doing so in public space and that our criticisms are being read by whoever logs on to that space.
From my own perspective, I find the comment posted above gratuitous and unnecessary.  Irrespective of that comment, I will continue to post what I consider a courtesy to others since that is how I intend it to be.  I do not intend to annoy anyone.  The guidelines for how to address other users are in Wikipedia:Etiquette, WP:NPA, and other places linked in WP:POL.  I try to follow these guidelines in what I post in Wikipedia. To assume otherwise is to violate WP:AGF.  I am posting this reply in good faith as well.   

To others who might be more interested than some in why I may not reply quickly or at all: I explain that in """"N.B."""", but not everyone consults a user's talk page when commenting in article talk pages, and so some may not see that explanation in """"N.B."""" above; therefore, I have mentioned that I would be offline in some of my recent comments in talk page article(s) that I have worked hard on in the past.  I will be back offline after this reply and will not see what anyone posts here until I return to check the functioning of the achiving bot (I don't know when that will be).  I have a massive amount of work to do offline over the next two weeks, which has been delayed in getting to me (thus I've been online occasionally in the past week from time to time), but I expect to be away from Wikipedia after this reply for indefinite and extended periods of time both during and after the next two weeks as well (on an extended """"wikibreak""""; please see the template notice above).

 Thank you for the assistance, really helps ) But in regards to the pages, you may be able to help me with a couple of questions. I know the songs by Kylie that I made have not charted, won an award, or have been covered by any artists as stated by WP:NSONGS, there are a selection of songs I found on Wikipedia by really famous artists that kinda sits on the same boat as these articles. For example, articles Superpower (song), Rocket (Beyoncé song) and Rocket (Beyoncé song) by American singer Beyonce are well cover just like my articles but have not charted, won an award or have been covered by a variety of artists as stated by the criteria (maybe the music video significance allows it on the site?), alongside Who Am I Living For? by American singer Katy Perry. Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like """"Too Far"""" and """"I Don't Need Anyone"""" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single. Also, the WP:NSONGS does say that those three criterias do not have to been needed but are afromented to. I'm not trying to make excuses, that is not my intention, but maybe you can help me out on this factor so I can have a clearer idea and mind on what I can do and cannot do with song/album articles.

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

There's a lot to learn when you first start editing Wikipedia, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn it all at once. It may be good to look at some high quality artistic biographies on Wikipedia, such as Bronwyn Bancroft or Dave Stamper to see how those articles do things. 
I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well. But it should only need another sentence or two before you move it into article-space, at Anneliese von Oettingen. I can help with that too, if you like. All the best, –  (talk)

1838,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

(The term constituent country being cited from the UK Government). These being as follows:
Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south with England. England (Cornish: Pow Sows) is a country that occupies most of the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares land borders to the north with Scotland and to the west with Wales. 
Wales (;Also spelled """"Gymru"""", """"Nghymru"""" or """"Chymru"""" in certain contexts, as Welsh is a language with initial mutations – see Welsh morphology. pronounced }) is a principality that occupies the largest western peninsula of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the east with England. Northern Ireland' (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann'') is a province that occupies the northeast of the island of Ireland. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.
All of the above terms are verifiable and can be cited from reliable sources, which in addition to the ISO include:

1869,"Dimitri & Nina 

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

 Deletion of """"Finney Ross"""" Master Leathersmith 

Dear Sir,

First off, I apologize if I mess this up, as I am a computer idiot.

My page on Finney Ross ... Master Leathersmith, was removed and I believe that to be an error.

Under section A47 it states """"It does not indicate how or why the subject is notable"""".

Finney Ross was a South Texas Pioneer in leathersmithing for the R.C.A. (at that time the Rodeo Cowboys Association. It has since been changed to the P.R.C.A.: Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association)

His works graced the likes of Larry Mahan, Freckles Brown, Jim Shoulders, Casey Tibbs (just to name a FEW and most are now P.R.C.A. Hall of Fame inductees.)

During Ross's leathersmithing days in the 50's, 60's and 70's ... it was unheard of in the rodeo world to have one leathersmith dominate an entire state. But Ross's works were so sought after, that famous cowboy after cowboy would only reccommend Ross.

To this day, not only are his works highly collectible and valuable because of WHO he was and WHAT he did, but Larry Mahan who is on the board of trustees for the P.R.C.A. still retains all of his Ross items and still speaks of his works and contibutions to the R.C.A. to this day. (You may contact Mr. Mahan to verify) 

The old days of Rodeo and all the history behind it are slowly fading away. I would much appreciate you putting the page back up. I know that it doesn't seem like much of a statement to the world, but in the world of rodeo...it actually is.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

 About Hispanic (Updated) - yet again 

First off, I take offense to your, """"relax, take a deep breath,"""" condescent remark. Never did I convey a """"nervous"""" tone with you in my plea for your understanding. I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all. Second of all, I'm of English and Spaniard descent who is sensitive to the falsehoods thus far stated in wiki pages concerning the English and Spaniards. For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary. There must be an appeals board within Wiki to whom I can supplicate my case. I hope that you understand my position. I look forward to making wiki a fair and informative base of knowledge.

 This article has been reviewed as part of Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force in an effort to ensure all listed Good articles continue to meet the Good article criteria. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed, listed below. I will check back in seven days. If these issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted (such a decision may be challenged through WP:GAR). If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Feel free to drop a message on my talk page if you have any questions, and many thanks for all the hard work that has gone into this article thus far.
GA review (see here for criteria):

This article fails primarily on WP:LAYOUT; there are far to many embedded lists. The whole article is really just a collection of lists, with short sections of prose in between. Even the """"Programs"""" section is really little more than a list disguised as prose. There are also major problems with the referencing; there are a great number of dead links, which I have marked, and there's an unfortunate mix of inline references and external links in the text.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; I really don't think there is any way of saving this article without extensive work. Still, I will give it the normal week on hold, please contact me if anybody decides to rewrite it.   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

WP:FAIRUSE is just an alias for Wikipedia:Non-free content so we are in agreement on the relevant policy. As for how to edit the quote, perhaps somethin like the following:

""""I was with her when she died. She left this world literally screaming at the top of her lungs. I was with her constantly, ... She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do anymore. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shutdown. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [during the last days] she was very funny. We didn’t have to [talk] because I always knew how she felt about me, I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn’t have to have these heart to heart talks.""""

It is a a dialog with Russo-skeptic interests—and since Mauco has branded me a partisan, I'll identify that as my """"partisanship."""" I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans. I see it as a naked Russian power play (and not the only such one currently) to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against NATO expansion. Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-skeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimally:
 the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and
 Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.
When that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.
   You keep talking about the parliament's """"opposition"""" to Smirnov. As a Russo-skeptic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some """"elections"""" which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. We can seriously discuss the will of the people:
after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);
after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become """"citizens of the PMR,"""" either;
after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); and
after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.
Then we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation. I have the patience to wait for that discussion, do you?

I object to it for several reasons.  The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

At night, transpiration usually does not occur because most plants have their stomata closed. When there is a high soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes, forming drops. Guttation is not to be confused with dew, which condenses from the atmosphere onto the plant surface.

 Khalifa Ezzat sourcing 

AHLM13, I took a quick glance at this article and there are some sourcing problems that existed from before your edits.  You added a couple of sources in the education section and I appreciate that.  I removed an existing source () which is a blog and those rarely make good sources for Wikipedia.  See the WP:SPS page for blogs in general.  For material about a living person (often called WP:BLP here), blogs are even more restricted for their use - see the WP:BLPSPS page.  On top of that, going to that page gives an error message and there really doesn't look like that blog has anything.  I've removed the blog (used twice as a source).  Any chance you might know of a better source for what the blog was used for?  I think it was the last two sentences in the lead.  

I'd love to find some sourcing for the rest - where the articles were published and ISBN numbers for the translations and books would be awesome.  If you know of any, would you mind adding it?  Even just bare links or raw ISBN and I can clean it up later.   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Re: References 

This article's references appear to be entirely bipolar.  The """"pro-Scientology"""" links all lead back to the Church of Scientology or members of it, while the """"Con"""" links lead to personal websites of self-proclaimed critics of the religion.  Are there any neutral sources available?  01:21, 10 January 2006 (EST)

It is hard to find a """"neutral"""" reference about Scientology.  Anyone that has studied it seriously soon discovers that its a viscious cult and a global scam, and therefore their """"neutral"""" report becomes a critical report.  There are sources in the media like Richard Lieby (now at the Wash Post) that have written numerous newspaper articles exposing the cult.  There has been an article in Time Magazine about the cult that was reprinted in Readers' Digest.  60 Minutes has done a couple of exposes on the cult as well, but none of these have been flattering for Scientology.   The task you are expecting is akin to asking someone looking into the pit of hell and write a neutral non-POV article about Satan incarnate.  Unfortunately, it just isn't possible.   

There is a page that purports to be a neutral resource at [Bernie's Scientology Pages], but even a cursory examination of his site shows that 99% of his words and pages are either criticizing critics of Scientology or making excuses for the Church of Scientology.  Most critics of Scientology believe that Bernie is in fact doing the work for the church.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.

There are many web pages that make the connection between Adam 12 and the matador, not to mention the Cox toy whose production was dependent on the product placement, which by the way, increases the notability since somethat happened elsewhere as a consequence. I actually watched Adam-12. Could you adopt a slightly more inclusionist approach, I don't understand your vision of cutting out to improve quality. It's pretty clear we can't put in every mention of a Crown Victoria police car, but for a car as obscure as this one, that makes it notable.  Also up on the talk page. TAB

- TABWhile V-8 power was down for many sedans, AMC used a 401 cubic inch V-8 that outpowered most other police sedans. 0 to 60 times were within 7 seconds, comparable to the 2006 Charger Hemi police car. Top speed was about 125 miles an hour, which took only 43 seconds, much faster than the previous 1970 Plymouth Satellites. These cars would be seen on later episodes of Adam-12, and Pink Floyd The Wall (film). The Adam-12 police car would also be the subject of a now-rare  Cox radio controlled gas powered replica.

 Please read, and in your case disprove, the theory before making a conclusion. 
Please read reliable sources and explain how the NU Journal of Discovery passes the test.   
 Sorry, I forgot who we are dealing with here, the Arrogant Science Party. How do you propose the theory should be linked to this topic, so people can read about alternative views? 

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait. Its physically impossible, as is the earth exploding.

Wikipedia style is for Wikipedia policy to determine
I have trouble understanding this conflict, people are saying such strange things. They're sort of understandable from a new user like Mr. Harvey, who seems unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy and principles, but I find them incomprehensible from a seasoned editor like Sam Spade. It seems to me self-evident that if Mr. Harvey controls the copyright, then we can't use the image other than under the conditions he dictates. And since those conditions include having an embedded, uneditable, caption, in violation of the wiki principle, that means we can't and won't use it at all. (That's  apart from the phrasing of the caption being IMO quite unacceptable—it's enough that it's uneditable.) Mr Harvey, it's just not the case that your regiment, or the Queen for that matter, is in charge of Wikipedia style. You seem to assume that all that's needed for your caption to carry absolute authority is that a spokesman for the regiment should """"clarify"""" the form of address / title, that """"should"""" be used, and then it will, it must, be used. You are wrong about that: forms of address and titles used here are matters for Wikipedia consensus and policy. Your employers are not empowered to dictate to the world how to speak. I can understand that you think they are, but I don't understand Sam at all. Sam, how can you see Mr. Harvey's demand to dictate the caption as part of an """"interpersonal conflict""""? It's a conflict of principle. You write: I have recieved an email stating that Richard Harvey is the Photo Archivist at the Duke of Wellington's Regimental HQ, and that a condition of their usage is that the the name, rank & title be embedded. That is good enough for me, I see no reason to doubt that this is the case, or to refuse to utilise the images under these conditions.. Those two conclusions are miles apart. No, there is no reason to doubt it. Yes, there is every reason to refuse to utilise the image under such conditions. It's a pity Mr. Harvey has had second thoughts about the image he uploaded the first time, the one without a caption, and it's, well, just... odd, that he sees cropping off the caption as defamation, but we'll have to live with that.  | talk """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

If you have any further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

 Attack on aimulti 

Dear Todd,

I have looked at your history and you seem to be a real Wikipedia editor. The person who is accused of being a sockpuppet of mine is known to me but other than that we have no connection by blood, business or anything else. 

The attack on every contribution I have made (107) pages covering a wide range of topics has been organised by a group called """"Dissident Action Group Exposed"""". Over the years they have distributed smear letters over the internet saying I am a child molester, blow up churches and other such nonsense. Do a yahoo search if you doubt my word.

Also look at the edit history of the two people I named. They both joined within one day of each other (only about 10 days ago) and have made hundreds of contributions since then. ALL ATTACKS ON AIMULTI.

You seem a fair person so all I ask is you check out what I have said above and then act as you see fit.

New Pages update
Hey  ). A quick update on how things are going with the New Page Triage/New Pages Feed project. As the enwiki page notes, the project is divided into two chunks: the """"list view"""" (essentially an updated version of Special:NewPages) and the """"article view"""", a view you'll be presented with when you open up individual articles that contains a toolbar with lots of options to interact with the page - patrolling it, adding maintenance tags, nominating it for deletion, so on.

On the list view front, we're pretty much done! We tried deploying it to enwiki, in line with our Engagement Strategy on Wednesday, but ran into bugs and had to reschedule - the same happened on Thursday (. We've queued a new deployment for Monday PST, and hopefully that one will go better. If it does, the software will be ready to play around with and test by the following week! ).

On the article view front, the developers are doing some fantastic work designing the toolbar, which we're calling the """"curation bar""""; you can see a mockup here. A stripped-down version of this should be ready to deploy fairly soon after the list view is; I'm afraid I don't have precise dates yet. When I have more info, or can unleash everyone to test the list view, I'll let you know ). As always, any questions to the talkpage for the project or mine. Thanks!

2447,"""A column that elaborates on how the filesystem handles tiny file data (of a few bytes, like 5) would be nice. I.e. does it waste an entire sector for it (or worse), does it store it alongside the directory entry (inside the directory """"file""""), does it store it inside the inode of some other file?

(This doesn't really overlap with """"extended attribute"""", because that's just another tiny file and really, regular tiny files are as interesting) 
  12:
This is called tail packing  
And block suballocation, which is a similar concept. I am unsure about file systems that keep short files with the directory or inode entry. I've heard something vague about NTFS keeping short files in the MFT; if this is true, it indeed isn't represented right now.   
This is correct. Tail packing and suballocation put multiple files into one block, but that is still discontigous from any other related information, like the inode block or directory listing. By contrast, NTFS stores data for *very* short (I don't have an exact number, but it's in the several hundred bytes region) files in the directory listing, which entirely eliminates a seek for the data. Perhaps a note of this fact in a footnote for the """"partial"""" suballocation support?

the or The? (re-stated proposal)
It seems that there is some confusion as to what is being proposed, with some editors believing the statement “the band’s name is The Beatles” to be a counter-argument to the proposal (in fact, the statement is a premise of the proposal), so I’ll try to re-present the argument more clearly.

Premises:
The band’s name is The Beatles.
The band’s name is not subject to any unusual capitalisation rules. (Were it otherwise, there would be WP:RSs commenting on the fact).
The band’s name is used in Wikipedia music articles.
MOS:MUSIC is “the Manual of Style, a style guide, for Wikipedia music articles”.
MOS:MUSIC#Names (definite article) instructs that, for band names starting with the definite article, “Mid-sentence, per the MoS, the word """"the"""" should in general not be capitalized” (and provides for exception, only on a usage basis, not a band basis).

Conclusion:
When the name The Beatles is used in Wikipedia music articles, the word the should not be capitalized mid sentence (excepting the specific constructs detailed in MOS:MUSIC).

Proposal:
Follow the MOS (per the above conclusion).

Notes:
The benefit in accepting the proposal is, per the MOS, more “consistent usage and formatting”, throughout music articles and Wikipedia as a whole.
Per WP:CCC, “editors need to re-examine each proposal on its own merits”, not “on what influenced a past consensus”.

Thanks for asking.

AdultVest has a history of self-insertion in various articles, so when I saw this firm again inserted into inappropriate articles, I presumed it was advertising. If your sincere intention was to improve those articles, then you have my apology.

Your contribution to the Sex industry article seems to describe the company while shedding very little light on that article's topic. As this firm seems to be an investment novelty, neither representing a trend, nor having its own significant influence on the industry, a paragraph in that article gives this business undue weight. It's a gratuitous mention, regardless of the reason for the insertion. This is the reason AdultVest is removed from that article.

The inclusion of AdultVest in Socially responsible investing is even less relevant. Obviously there are many trivial examples of investing that might be considered not socially responsible, and the inclusion of AdultVest is both questionable as an illustration, and violates WP:NPOV in the presumption that the sex industry is particularly opposite of social responsibility. The best examples are ones that need the least amount of argument that they are in fact exemplary.

If you wish to contest the inclusion of """"numerous references"""" to other companies in either of those articles, I would recommend you take it to the article Discussion pages. Your objections to those companies is not a rationale for including AdultVest. I hope this makes sense and seems fair to you.

Mistake in vandalism reversal

I reverse the changes also added to the article by the unsigned individual. There is some content here that might be worth retaining and incorporating into the article. 
However, 
 the same individual also removed my comments from the talk page. This amounts to censorship and suggests at minimum bad faith in regard to the wikipedia process of revising articles.
 the new content was a quick cut and paste from some previous text as shown by the fact the section left its original references at the end and a """"summary"""". As I noted above not all this new material is inappropriate.

By the way, the exercise physiology wikipedia article was mentioned in the Guardian today by a friend as an example of the problems of creating encyclopedia articles on wikipedia.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Kurdistan?

Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish """"state"""" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.

Your colleague has already given an example of lack of attribution.  
He lied. The real author is clearly stated on the page if you'd bothered to look. And the source stated on the main news page (although you'd have to go into the history to look for it.) 
And you can prove that copyright holds after publication by simply going down to your local newsagents and looking in a few magazines.
Strawman argument. I never said it did, liar.

Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

No RESULTS!

This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

2682,"Seems like a lot is missing from this article, especially the part about the atom bomb.
Here's a few reviews from Amazon.com:

A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 

This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. 
Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. 

Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States. 

The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. 

Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor. Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. 

Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated. 

emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006   

I read this book in the CIA-translated version as a Senate aide concerned about the rise of Japan, which included as co-author one of the leaders of Sony (Morita). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, Japan was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into US missiles), and the US was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that Japan would take as to be laughable. 

In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that Ishihara did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. Japan's economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations (TQM, just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in Asia - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. 

Ishihara understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the US bombed Japan, but not Germany with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant.

 Statement 

I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint.

 Contested deletion 

This page is not unambiguously promotional, because... (your reason here)   

FWIW I haven't worked at the company for over 8 years, I originally created the page to contribute to Wikipedia on a subject which, at the time, I knew about.  I don't know how accurate what is written is at the moment as I haven't followed it, but I know the company does still exist as I have a friend who still works there.  While I agree the wording of the opening 2 sentences at the moment do now come across a bit 'marketing-ey' (I'm guessing someone has edited since it was created), as a Wikipedia user I'd find it stranger a big company wouldn't have a page on Wikipedia than that the page had some marketing speak.  Rather than deleting the page entirely, why not just fix it by cutting down to the first two sentences to just have the facts about what it does and size?  eg:  """"Isobar is a global full service digital marketing agency with over 70 locations, across 44 markets worldwide""""?

In the movie, the priests and royalty at the top of the period show that they are *not* frightened of the eclipse and know full well it will pass. One of the them gives a cynical smile to another, since they know they can fool the masses below.

Moral: Gibson is not being inaccurate. They knew about eclipses, and exploited this knowledge to keep the masses in awe.

Please change the references in the article.

 Your POV 

Dear Nlitement,
Unfortunately your point of view is not correct. I won't say it is hypocrisy though, it might be rude... 
I am not, but you are, comparing these two incidents... What I am saying is in these two cases Europian has different standards. I cannot see what is hard for you to see in this? By the way I am not supporting what has happened in some muslim countries. That is wrong too. I do not have double standars...  

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire! 

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/True Combat: Elite 
As per your comments here, it's obvious you flooded AfD with several mod articles as retaliation for your article being nominated. This is unnacceptable behavior, and if you continue to show such aggression, you may be blocked in the future.  
Call it what you want, the fact is you basically admit to doing it to prove a point in SEVERAL places. Whatever your reasoning for it is, the plain fact is that its against wikipedia policy, no matter how you sugercoat it.  
 Hi 
I would like to ask one person who voted on True Combat: Elite deleting. Do you even play games? Have you even heard about the mod? Have you checked anything about it? Have you seen my phat and big comment where I mentioned a lot of obvious reasons for notability. You don't have to answer. I know the answer.  [talk] 
Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

You are suppressing the POV that is stated in the SF Chronicle “that no one was forced and that no laws were broken” which seems highly relevant given the allegations. So I am saying that the phrasing you are selecting suffer from undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording. Also from WP:NPOV “Verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.
Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited. The two are different questions, and both must be considered in full, in deciding how the matter should be presented in an article."""" So based on this I am also reverting.

As I already expressed on the Talk page prior to the 7 day block, it's proven futile for me to try to maintain the agreed version (pending revision through further discussion and consensus), as my efforts to undo the reverts of people who refuse to make any kind of effort to discuss their objections on Talk continually (well, twice, prior to this 7 day thing, which doesn't count on this point) result in me getting blocked. Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me.

Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

""""The footpath sign was a result of an abortive attempt to photograph the south portal of the Milford Tunnel - I did not think the golfers would take kindly to my walking across their fairways and I am not sure how else to get to it."""" When I went train spotting, I used to walk along the edge of the field at the opposite side off the Milford Road, opposite the signal box. The North Portal is said to be prettier and you seem to have caught it in a rare moment when it wasn't deep in shade. I like 058133 - the train gives it a bit of movement.

There are loads of photos around but they are all copyright. My solution is to link to  websites that are lkely to be permanent. """"Picture the Past"""" has a photo of Toadmoor Tunnel which really shows the elliptical shape.

058162 would show Ambergate station as it is now. Belper and Duffield have been similarly erased. 

I'm sure I should know what Chatter is. I have this feeling it's  limestone pebbles from the quarries that you'd use for a driveway. I'll have to ask around, or perhaps we could ask on the """"Voices"""" BBC programme that's coming up.

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

Hello, I would like an admin to see the pages Jajce and Alija Izetbegovic and judge whether the sourced information that was removed by user Rochass is justified. 

On the Jajce article, he removed a cited statement about a church being destroyed even though it is cited and there is even a picture of the demolished church. He claims it is irrelevant information while it is very much relevant: there is a paragraph on the Bosnian War and this very much falls into that category.

As for the Izetbegovic article, he: 1) removed historical information (the original birth country), 2) changed """"Bosnian mujahideen"""" for """"Arab Volunteers"""" when there is already an article on the former, 3) removed two """"citation needed"""" notices, 4) removed a quote by Richard Holbrooke, US Envoy, about the issue of the aforementionned Bosnian mujahideen, 5) Added """"Serb Nationalists"""" as those who petitioned the ICTY to indict Izetbegovic so as to make it seem unjustified when in reality he died before the investigation ended.

I have tried to discuss these issues on his talk page but he does not wish to participate in a dialogue and simply reverts my edits. I don't wish to get into a full fledged edit war and that is why I would like an administrator to take a look at the issue. Thank you in advance for your help! )""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

An example could be """"you're a train spotter so what would you know about fashion?""""

Wow, interesting information.  First, let me say that I don't doubt the truth of what you're saying.  However, because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source, it qualifies as original research, which is not permitted on Wikipedia.  Typically, this type of information would have to be removed from an article.  Given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation, however, I'll leave it in with the """"citation needed"""" tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon (I'll look tomorrow).  I feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source, however, another editor could come along and justifiably remove it.

I reject this notion

The article claims """"The defeat was attributed to massive vote splitting with the Greens, which in many cases allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and win""""  This claim is nonsensical when compared to the fact that the Liberals won 57% of the popular vote province wide.  Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.  The NDP would still have lost 76.92% of their total seats in the legislature.  

So as a consequence I'm removing that sentence.

 Project News
 The LGBT Portal has once again been revamped and a work rota started. Efforts towards Featured Portal status are slowly coming together.
 The assessment system has been a great success, we have tagged over 4000 articles! Please tag any LGBT related articles you come across by adding {{LGBTProject | class=}} to the talkpage. Please see the Assessment Department for how to assess an article according to the grading system.
 The Translation department has changed its focus, to LGBT articles about non-English topics and people on which there may be more information on the relevant foreign Wikipedia. Please add your name if you are fluent in any language other than English.
 Jumpaclass is picking up slowly, with nine people having entered. With over 2000 stubs we need to improve our article quality. Please sign up and get it going! Challenge another user to see how far you can jump a stub!
 There is an ongoing discussion about the current LGBT categorisation system here, here, and  a little bit here. A special page has now been set up here to deal with this.
 A Watchlist has been set up to monitor controversial and/or highly vandalised articles. It can also be used for article disputes, just add a note explaining the nature of the dispute.
 With the influx of so many active members, there is now enough support for a LGBT studies peer review, which may be found here. It's in the beta phase at the moment, so bear with us if we make any mistakes. Feel free to peer review any articles you have been working on.
  It was agreed this month to start reducing the uses of the Notice board, as many members felt that it was not effective. An open tasks template has been created, bringing together important announcements, FAC/FARs, Peer reviews, XfDs, the COTM, and requested articles. You may desire to [ watchlist] it. A Deletion sorting subpage is also now working to bring together XfDs - this should be bot-driven, but we have not currently tagged enough articles to make this fully automated, so please update the list with any LGBT-related XfDs you come across.

 Two articles were recently shepherded through the Featured Article process by two of our members - Same-sex marriage in Spain and The Well of Loneliness.  Congratulations go to (respectively)  and !

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa.

The army had estimates of Indian casualties, some based upon observed burials, and others not.

Historical research is a great pleasure and requires a degree of rigor. We will never get it right, but we can try.

I recommend all  read Carol Reardon's 'Pickett's Charge in History & Memory,' Chapple Hill, 1997, University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0-8078-2379-1.

""""Frustration will likely remain the lot of the purists. As a disgruntled veteran noted in 1913, """"Pickett's charge has been so grossly exaggerated and misrepresented as to give some color to the oft-repeated axiom that 'history is only an agreed-upon lie."""" This, the second to last sentence in her book, cited """"Pickett's Charge,"""" National Tribuen, January 29, 1914.

How to block this IP without blocking all of north New Jersey
Herby and ABF: Wikipedia found a way to block this IP range without blocking the entire range.  If you look at this thread on ANI, the message by Wknight tells you the range to block to at least make it more of a pain for the person to have to continually reset their modem until they find an open protocol.  I suggest we do that for about a month here.   

Whizkids Herby and ABF: apparently that does not work as I'm here, and I have been there, too.

David: if only you could stay off """"substances"""" for about a month (how long has it been since you've been without for a month, since you started?), and undergo psychiatric help in the same period, to start.

Hey Herby - it did work on WP - but if it doesn't, that IP range may not be as active on Commons as it is on WP, and so you may just want to block the whole range.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard
Zuck: Just ask.
Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS
[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?
Zuck: People just submitted it.
Zuck: I don't know why.
Zuck: They """"trust me""""
Zuck: Dumb fucks.

In another instant message (IM)

FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?
ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them
ZUCK: probably in the year
ZUCK: *ear

The book Hungary and the Hungarians (Matthias Corvinus Publishers, 2012, ed. S. J. Magyaródy, ISBN 1-882785-23-1) is an edited volume of articles, most of which document or discuss purported anti-Hungarian sentiment and discrimination.  The book has a clear nationalistic (bordering on irredentist) agenda, but it is certainly the most comprehensive overview of the topic which I've found, and helps establish its notability for our puproses.  It can probably be used as a reliable source for nationalist views on anti-Hungarian sentiment, and (where its claims are corroborated with other, less avowedly polemic sources) for factual descriptions of specific historical incidents. —",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 First, I don’t want to silence flat Earth believers in what they say; however, I would like to point out what is said might be biased or flawed based on some reasons. NPOV should address all aspects of the issues no matter how small it is.  If someone makes a statement, there can be counter arguments. Wiki doesn’t have section A devoted to supporters and section B for proponents; therefore, the statements of both can be discussed in a fair and even through out the article. So is it not appropriate to have point counter point within the article?  Fair question, not trying to troll, but deserving a fair answer and if this is not the case then I will re-re-re-read the NPOV stuff.  But if it is allowed then the line that is in debate should stand as somewhat similar to the way I wrote it.

The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology. See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts. I know that the meaning of churl is different, but it is the same etymological root, ultimatly from *kar(i)laz, sure, but through an intermediate West Germanic form *keril-.

 Why are there no images? Is it because this is madness? 

It's not like he saw flaming penises rape hell. The visions in this book are visual/picturesque/photogenic, popular with artists and not at all child-disturbing. They need to be seen. Even simple diagrams could help anyone studying this book to keep track of what Ezekiel sees and conquer the poetry. The symbolism should be analyzed, organized, compared to other instances, and linked to relevant articles, to better understand. At least make a list of symbols used. This is one of the most encyclopedia-friendly books in the Book, and could shed light on topics such as Cherub, Vision (religion), Cubit, &c.; Feel free to draw your own (accurate) version, as images can bypass the no-original-research rule. A beautiful picture could earn the article status such as """"cool"""" with females or """"Royal"""" with England. But it doesn't have to be National-Geographic-quality. If it's too much, it could be moved to another Exegesis of the Book of Ezekiel page that analyzes the most important interpretations, including things like Suzanne Haik-Vantoura's decipher.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

A while ago, I made some edits that Johntex didn't like, and so instead of trying to resolve it on the article discussion page, he posted a wildly dishonest complaint in which he resorted to outright lying about me to get me blocked from editing the page for a month (his initial goal being to get me completely banned). I continued to be outraged at his behavior and the fact that he remains completely unpunished for his behavior, and posted complaints on his talk page. Once again, rather than trying to resolve it, he went here to lie about me in his continued belief that anyone who annoys him should be banned. And yet again, he posted numerous lies:

5 days ago, with no provocation whatsoever, Heqwm made a personal attack against me on my talk page. As explained above, the claim that there was no provocation whatsoever is an outright lie.

I have never posted lies about him. Another lie.

I left him a message on his talk page asking him to provide diffs to back up his allegations. He declined to do so. Another lie. I pointed out that I had provided him with the diffs over and OVER again, and each time he simply lied and said that they don't say what he said they clearly said.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

-

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism.""""

Political comments on ancient times articles
While it's good that you want to prevent disruption to articles, I would thank you to please not use the talk pages of ancient times stuff to discuss contemporany political stuff as you did on Talk:Alexander the Great. See the WP:TALK wikipedia style guideline on commenting on talk pages   

The point was to address the recurring references that suggest """"Macedonia wasn't Greek"""" in the Alexander Talk pages. Clearly their intent is political in nature and some sort of disclaimer seemed in order to prevent unauthentic contributions. 

Although I disagree with your choice to completely remove a disclaimer in the Alexander talk page (not the main article) as I mentioned in your own talk page I will accept the removal( since I'm new here and bow to your wisdom). I only ask that you please consider my concerns that the talk page is heavily politicized already.

  

You are right that the talk page can get very politized (it changes with time as old discussions get archived, and new discussions get opened). A warning (not a disclaimer) could be good, but it ought to be at the top of the page (with the other boxes at the top of the talk page) and be very short and neutral, and its rationale should rely on historical sources for ancient times, and not on the current political situation. Sorry for taking so long, but I had stuff to do outside of wikipedia.   

Would it be possible for you to add the warning Enric? This way if could be done to your own satisfaction?  

I made a short warning. It's all I could think of. I copied the code from Talk:Homeopathy.

3366,"Why Lineal shouldn't be here 

Let's go back to when the Lineal/The Ring title didn't exist. Back then, there was only a World Champion.

Then the title's were split. First between the WBA (Known also by othernames) and WBC, then later the IBF was recognized and even later the WBO.

When the titles were first split, The Ring Magazine created a The Ring title. This belt was awarded to all reigning World Champions. Challengers could win it by beating them. Should someone vacate it, the only way to win it would be to be recognized by The Ring as the No.1 or No.2 fighter in your division and beat the other man ranked 1 or 2 (Some exceptions were made for No.3)

Then came the unfortunate decision in the 1990s by The Ring to stop awarding these titles. But they did not stop ranking fighters. When the No.1 and No.2 fighters fought and a victor came out, that person was dubbed the Lineal Champion.

An example is Floyd Mayweather, Jr.; Lineal Super Featherweight Champion from 1998-2001 (Ring belts were awarded again in 2002).

Mayweather worked his way up to the No.2 spot and challenged No.1 and WBC Champion Genaro Hernández. He was considered the Lineal Champion because there was no The Ring Champion.

Naseem Hamed won the Lineal title and lost it in a period when The Ring titles weren't being awarded. The man who beat him for his title, Marco Antonio Barrera, was later awarded The Ring title. His Lineal title was switched with the The Ring title because the Lineal title only existed as a substitute. 

This applies for Lennox Lewis. He was awarded the The Ring title when awarding them began again in 2002. Therefore, the Lineal title was NOT on the line in his fight with Vitali Klitschko. Any objections?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

I agree with your statements and the reverts. I would like to add some different thoughts.
I prefer incremental addition of material, because it ensures a proper peer-review process. Adding 60kb on a single day is just too much to control. 
The sudden addition of long paragraphs also raises the question where this material comes from. Of course, the editor might be extremely gifted and produce an unbelievable amount of information in almost no time. But suspicions that the material is copy-pasted are not too far fetched, I think. Especially, when seeing that the style differs drastically between different section (e.g., the way references are coded).

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is """"something that can be demonstrated to be true"""", in other words, """"something based on empirical evidence"""". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

I'd like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section. I won't try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the """"life on Mars"""" page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.

However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

Not sure the recent edit changing Tyler from """"Anarchist"""" to """"Nihilist"""" is accurate. Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  17:56, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Bad LOGIC

=Progressivism
On the progressivism and economic progressivism pages  some editors have deleted criticism on the following grounds.

1.  The article needs to be expanded first.
2.  The article needs to be improved first.
3.  Criticsm section puts undo weight on negatives.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.

1.  If the article needs expanding, expand it...criticism also helps expand.  THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title.
2.  The article is improved just by including a criticism section.  Again, THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title. Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV.
3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.
4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.
5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

All were poorly reasoned excuses to delete material they objected to.  These editors are not trying to preserve the integrity of wikipedia or be """"Fair and balanced"""" they are simply trying to push a leftist political objective by censoring any alternative regardless of the source.

Classical Liberalism

Editor Slizor has deleted several sections and paragraphs which were cited and refrenced, including quotes from economists and think tanks on various things which Slizor has expressed disagreement with.  Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).

This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.

The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.

Hello again.

I dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One to ask for suggestions for selected articles on portal:Formula One. There was a pretty good response, both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested. Damon Hill came out with the most support and was brought up to Good Article standard after a lot of work by Skully Collins before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at Featured Article Candidates as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?).

Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the Damon Hill article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July).

You may also want to help with the article Gilles Villeneuve, which was the next most popular after Damon Hill. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Laveol: Even last name Kolisev is a Macedonian one. Last names ending with """"ev"""", """"ov"""" are not Bulgarian. It happens that you have those in Bulgaria. But you have those last names in Macedonia, Russia, Check Republic, and so on.

Kolisev is a Macedonian last name. Same is Kolisevski. You can find both kinds with """"ov|ova"""", """"ev|eva"""", """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""" and others in Republic of Macedonia. So changing a last name from Kolisev to Kolisevski does not have any Bulgarian/AntiBulgarian implications. My last name is """"Janev"""". You can find in Macedonia also """"Janevski"""", """"Janeski"""". All of those are Macedonian last names. The fact that you can have """"Janev"""" in Bulgaria does not translate to ethnicity/origin claims in Macedonia.

Here are some last names that finish on """"ov"""", """"ev"""" and are not Bulgarian neither Macedonian:

[Sergei Lavrov]
[Anton Chekhov]
[Martina Navratilova]

So these last name endings are typical but not exclusive for some of the Slavic languages.
Same is with """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""", """"ich"""" which are shared between a number of Slavic languages.

To come back to Kolisevski: Kolisevski is a Macedonian last name, as well is Kolisev. If you can find a person living in Bulgaria with one of those last names, and probably you could not, does not gives any conclusion about ethnicity or being a Pro-Bulgarian.   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

3530,""":: You said modern economics encompasses heterodox views, however in the opening modern economics is linked directly in the same sentence to the idea that value is derived from marginal utility (as opposed to labor).  That sentence, linking the word modern to that value theory, is what seems POV, not the phrase modern economics if """"modern economics"""" also includes those theories that embrace the LTV (labor theory of value).  But the sentence that was in the article doesn't.

 You are correct that there was a citation, one reason I did not mention it is I had no access to what was cited so there was no reason to mention it, as what was said was illogical, cite or no cite.  With regards to what is being discussed - we can discuss what is POV and not POV, what belongs where and so forth, and compromise and whatnot, but this sentence was so illogical and so out of wack it seems to demand change.  I looked up the cite and now understand the problem.  Let us compare what was said in the old opening to the opening of what J.E. Roemer said in the cite.

 Old opening - Thus, in Marx’s labour theory of value, value is considered as a measure of labor exploitation,[1] rather than of price.

 The first sentence of the work cited - For Marx, the labour theory of value was not a theory of price, but a method for measuring the exploitation of labour.

 Roemer says that for Marx the labor theory of value is a method for measuring the exploitation of labour, and is not a theory of price.  Which may be correct or incorrect, which may be phrased well or phrased confusingly, but at least it makes sense as an argument.  Roemer does not say value is considered a measure of labor exploitation.  There is a big difference between """"labor theory of value...method"""" and value itself.  Whether or not one agrees with Roemer, or thinks his sentence is well-written or not, he is not saying what he is cited in the article as saying.

I had already been told why they weren't vandalism?  The reasoning offered was insufficient.  I quoted from the rules.  I showed where he broke the rules.  That was never refuted.  
I warned a vandal.  He reverted the warning more than once.  He never replaced it with one that he felt was more appropriate.  How can I not assume you are biased in this matter?  You are carrying on a very fascinating conversation with him on your talk page about groking or whatever, and I get blocked?  I make one comment you deem inappropriate and denounce it as """"scathing""""?  
Let's look at the wrong behavior Daedalus engaged in on WP:ANI just now:
""""I knew he wouldn't really notice the block...""""  That's false.  I noticed the block.
I'm done assuming good faith with you.  WP:AGF  blatant.
...you're trolling for some kind of response.""""  False, and fails to assume good faith.
""""You have so far been nothing but disruptive."""" False, and basically the same kind of comment I just got a one week block for.
""""...the way you warned those IPs is classified as a personal attack."""" False, and false statements about other editors are not allowed under the civility rules.
""""You've been nothing but rude since you got here...""""  False, as his statement contains an absolute.  Even using the most liberal definition of rude, I have not been """"nothing but rude...""""
""""...the user claimed that I was ready to resign...""""  False, and that represents a serious misrepresentation of my comment.
""""this information that he claimed to have had(but of course, did not) about me resigning...""""  False, as I never claimed to have information about him resigning.  Patently false.
""""...that was a twinkle edit summery, an edit summery that is created automatically by the script when in use...""""  Using automation isn't a defense to bad edits or edit summaries.
""""I removed your message from my review...""""  He concedes to vandalism.
""""...you might be something else...""""  Obvious failure to assume good faith.
""""Are you sure you read that entire page?""""  Sarcasm during a heated debate is quite clearly incivility.
As a side note, I see Redvers has accused me of calling established editors """"vandals"""" on Wikipedia.  As far as I remember, that too is false.  I said Daedalus969 committed vandalism, and I said he was on the side of vandals, but I never called him a vandal.  Keep in mind also that what Redvers just did, by the rules, was incorrect.   
Yet, for my one alleged mistake, I get a one week block.  Daedalus, on the other hand, gets not so much as even one warning?  This is a mockery.  How I am I supposed to think, given the evidence, that you weren't doing anything other than looking for one mistake on my part, whether real or imagined, to hit me with a block?  You're having a friendly conversation with this guy while he's committing vandalism, incivility, personal attacks, page blanking, false statements, and bad edit summaries, and I get toasted for one arguable slip?  No, no, no, """"scathing"""" slip.  Please.  
Note also that many of his bad moves such as this have absolutely no merit.  Please tell me, how much of his nonsense was I supposed to be able to endure?  The deck was stacked.  He's breaking the rules while making accusations against me, and I'm expected to turn the other cheek how many times?  I guess since I said I was done in my last WP:ANI post, it might have seemed like the last chance to hit me with a block, rather legitimate or not.

Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudson's Bay Company, which maintained a post at San Francisco, though perhaps not this late (their post was at Yerba Buena (town) and had been founded in 1830.

You are both wrong, Wild Wolf, you say Confederate Arizona was apart of Union New Mexico territory. This is completely false.

Union Arizona territory did not exist until 1863, the campaigns occurred in 1861 and 1862, at the time of the Mesilla and Valverde engagements happened in the region of Confederate Arizona, this is fact. Whoever changed it back was seriously lazy about it, although I will not explain why.

Cuchullain, you say it should be named New Mexico Campaign because that is what most other people call it. Well I am sorry If I dont think we should babdly name an article because most people are too stupid to realize the fighting occurred in Arizona Territory aswell and not just New Mexico.

 Not a hallucinogen? 

This article states some effects of LSD use such as: """" an experience of radiant colors, objects and surfaces appearing to ripple or """"breathe,"""" colored patterns behind the eyes"""", and then states that LSD is not truly a hallucinogen. Webster defines hallucinogen as a substance which brings about hallucinations when ingested, and defines hallucination as """"a perception of objects with no reality usually arising from disorder of the nervous system or in response to drugs (as LSD)"""" quoted exactly. So yeah, I really think that going as far to say LSD isn't really a hallucinogen is stretching the definition of the word, considering that colors behind the eyes and surfaces moving around are actually hallucinations.

Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0

Your contributed article, Carlos Vives discography
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Carlos Vives discography. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Carlos Vives. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Carlos Vives - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

 Toilets in the """"sitting"""" position 

This regards your comment on the ancient toilets supposedly used in the sitting position. A few points:

1.  The toilets discussed in the quote were not Roman toilets, the ones shown in the picture.

2.  I contacted Dick Teresi, the author of the quote, asking him how he knew that the toilets were used in the sitting position.  He refused to reply to my question.  I suspect that he has made the same mistake that is often made by tourists who sit on the ancient Roman toilets.  They see footpads as """"seats"""", due to their cultural insularity.

This is ridiculous.
Aside from the reference not actually calling it a war crime, saying that """"some"""" characterize it as one doesn't make it one.
War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.  The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral.

I'm archiving this section because the pettiness simply is non-productive.  Let's try to figure out something that we can do constructively with these articles.  An A7 CSD was clearly wrong, but let's face it, most of these articles deserve to die.  The question is how to handle this constructively, which is what is going on above.  Let's stop quibbling over the rules and work towards getting something constructive done.-' NO! I'm Spartacus! 

Steve, I can tell you one way which will not work for the articlesand that is to do as you have done, and deleted some of them as G4, as if the AfD had closed the way you wanted it, not as keep. And the many you deleted (as did Orderinchaos) as dg-a7, non-notable person, in total defiance of WP:CSDA7.    The closer told you the right waynominate for deletion the ones you want to, individually.   I've asked you both on your talk page to restore them.  Sarah, can you explain to them about the inadvisability of outright   defiance of Wikipedia policy?  After we get this cleanup up, I'll talk a little about proper merging/redirect. As you may guess, I shall almost certainly to revert any redirects or merges except with consensus for each article. That does not mean I might not agree to some , most, or even all of them if procedure is followed properly. '  
I would suggest that threatening the community to edit war against it when it is trying to find a solution to a problem and work through differing and even opposing points of view to mutual satisfaction, is neither a wise nor an advisable course of action. Your behaviour at the past AfD is already under scrutiny - you openly defied policy in ways I have never actually seen from an admin who managed to keep his bit thereafter. VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress). A bit of cooperation rather than snarky threats to disrupt and offline abuse of contributors would go a long way from you, DGG. Orderinchaos 
No, but I can explain to you about the inadvisability of outright defiance of Wikipedia's policy on wheel and edit warring. The edit war policy states """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute."""" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the """"confrontational"""", """"combative"""" and """"non-productive"""" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the """"proper"""" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah 
I've also received some interesting info in recent days about unrelated disputes, and have made the relevant authorities aware. The odd bit is that there isn't even a dispute here as such between the different active, editing parties here - merely differing positions on notability which can actually be negotiated. The editors who come to this as fans have said they are - 1. willing to work with us; 2. willing to help with content. In return, we as the editors who come to this from the policy issues side have said we are - 1. willing to work with them; 2. willing to help with content.

Hi Solipsist, first I would like to say thanks very much for your kind comments and observations on my modern art contributions, and the gift of the wonderful revolving barnstar. It was quite unexpected and made my evening. 

I've noticed your continual contributions too—as have others too, judging from your barnstars—and was already wondering whether I could leave one for you, when one appeared for me! This is my first time for awarding a barnstar, and I hope it is acceptable!

I would be grateful, when you have the time, if you could cast your eye over the Damien Hirst article, as I would like to bring this up to featured article level. I haven't got enough experience to know what might need to be done, and how far short it would be at the moment. Any pointers would be welcome. I think it has the potential to make a very notable featured article.

“""""argument by argument"""" (tm)”?  If you have to invent a fallacy then even you have to know that you’re grasping for straws.

Collect, we do not have to say “the world is regarded as being round by some members of the scientific community” any more than we have to say “water has never definitively been proven to be wet”.  While I would personally prefer that we said something like “Ham’s claims have been disproven by modern science” (because I think it sounds more authoritative), if it’s between “incorrect” or nothing then “incorrect” is clearly the superior choice because it is factually true.

And please don’t try that “all the intelligent readers already know he’s wrong so there’s no need to point out that he’s wrong” argument.  Every fringe-pusher and their uncle has already tried that tactic and it’s bullshit.  We can’t just allow Wikipedia to be full of rubbish and assume that the smart readers will filter the fact from the fiction.  76.107.171.90

Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as """"judo"""" or """"kenjutsu"""") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's """"official"""" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included """"Kenjutsu"""" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use """"Aikijujutsu"""" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) """"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu"""".

Regarding the hyphen in """"aiki-jujutsu"""", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with """"aikijujutsu"""", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes """"aikijujutsu"""" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to """"aikijujutsu"""", if anyone feels strongly about it.

 Warning 

I am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious, and I am asking you kindly to back off, as I am starting to get annoyed. I am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. You pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the 1965 Palm Sunday article. If you would simply do some basic fact checking, this could all be avoided

My change to """"Lacon, IL"""" was sourced via Grazulis, and you obviously reverted because you saw my username, and didn't even check or research the validity of my edit. I would bet money that if any other user made that edit, you wouldn't have reverted it. If you have this idea that I make willy-nilly edits with no basis, then you are mistaken. I dig through hours online resources, old newspaper archives, books, and pdf documents to find my information. I take pride in providing valuable, detailed, and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. Seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. All I ask is for you to trust me a little more, and actually READ the sources and information provided.

 King Hammurabi 
King Hammurabi ruled a place in Mesopotamia called Babylonia. He was a very tough king. He was one of the first kings to write laws for his people. But he was the first king to hang his rules/ laws up in every place in Babylonia, so if someone breaks the law, no one can complain or tell they never noticed or read the laws. These laws are called The Hammurabi Code. 

 The Hammurabi Code 
The Hammurabi code are laws written in stone. Scientists had found a stone of laws written by a priest that was told to write the laws that King Hammurabi said. one of the laws are """"If you kill a father's son in the fire, then your son will be killed in the fire too."""" or """"If you steal something during a fire, then you will chop off your hands.""""

 Filipacchi """"emigrant"""" category issue 

This is a tricky and interesting matter of definition, which I've been discuss with Obi-Wan Kenobi. We decided to move it over here.  Filipacchi is currently in the category of """"French emigrants to the United States."""" But is Filipachi an """"emigrant""""? Given that she was an American citizen at birth (because of her mother's American citizenship).

Hope it's okay to print our discussion as a dialogue. (Certainly it's dramatic...)

ME: Here's the legal definition of """"immigrant"""" (and emigrant is just the inverse, of course):

""""An Immigrant is a person who has citizenship in one country but who enters a different country to set up a permanent residence. Just entering another country does not make you an immigrant. In order to be an immigrant you must have citizenship in one country, and you must have gone to a different country with the specific intention of living there.""""

It seems clear that Filipacchi does not qualify as an immigrant, since she already had citizenship. For this reason she can't be an emigrant either.

Agreed? I don't want to revert your edit myself - as it looks like an editing war; I'll leave it to you to do the reversion, if we're in accord here. 

OBI-WAN-KENOBI: I don't think emigrant is a legal term in our category structure - it really is more about what happened. She grew up in paris, speaking french, and then moved, leaving paris behind, for NY. I think calling that emigrant is fair - regardless of citizenship status.
emigrant: """"a person who leaves one place or country, esp a native country, to settle in another """" Also, you can be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time - it's really a question of perspective. 

ME: Yes, you in fact HAVE to be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time. You can't be one or the other. Hence the definition of """"immigrant"""" is all that matters. My problem is that to call Filipacchi an """"emigrant"""" is in fact *incorrect*, looked at from the perspective of the US government. It doesn't have to be a legal matter - I'm simply regarding this as the most rigorous definition that we have. This is taken from a legal site that advises UK citizens on how to emigrate to America:

""""The US government considers an immigrant to be someone who is not a US citizen, but who has received clearance to permanently reside in the US.""""
http://www.immigrationassist.co.uk/immigration/us-immigration/ 

What this suggests is that it is logically impossible to emigrate to the US if you are already a US citizen. 

OBI-WAN-KENOBI: Emigrant doesn't have the same legal definition - and it arguably applies, because """"france"""" was just as much """"her country"""" as the US is. we'd probably best bring this to her talk page in any case.

That's where it stands now. Currently she is in the emigrant category.  Thoughts?   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 WTF?! want != need 

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

Daria Huerta invented Liquid Fire. The term """"liquid fire"""" was created in 1960 and the product was invented in 1940. Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called """"Fire in the Water"""" then they started calling it what it truly is """"Liquid Water"""". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001.

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.

I notice that while blocked you continued to edit the talk page with an IP. This is not permitted and I would be within policy and custom to reblock you for this, see WP:SOCK. I decline this time to do so, but I warn you not to repeat this or further measures will be taken against you. I hope this will not become necessary as you will not require to be blocked again. Do not edit war, see WP:EW, but discuss with your sources (see WP:IRS and WP:V) on the talk page, under your proper account. 

I know that editing here is a steep learning curve and I am willing to help you do it right. You must accept that we are a mature community with very well-established policies and customs. If you come here you have to work within that, just like if you get a job in a university you have to listen to the people who are already working there. I can tell you have a lot to offer to the project. Please make your arguments in talk, be patient and kind to the folks who wrote the article (I am not one but was asked to look at this by someone who is. This does not mean I endorse their opinion on how the article should read.) even (especially) when you disagree with their writing, and accept that you will seldom get all of what you want, just as in most areas of life. I am a volunteer just like you, but I have been around for a good while and I am entrusted with the janitorial role of making sure that things don't get damaged. In support of that role I am allowed to block users, protect articles from editing and certain other powers. I would very much rather not use them any further here. I am also a science graduate, and have some passing understanding of the subject you are here to edit, for whatever that may be worth.

Please resume your discussions in talk, but please do not edit-war or sock again. Let me know if you need any further help and I will be glad to offer it to you.

The good cop bad cop, all-in-one schizo stuff is kinda weird; & your paternalism is waaaay off the mark. Ignoring you was not """"unwise"""", & I am hardly intimidated by your inadequate mastery of the rules you wish to nail to the wall. Perhaps you should review these dictates more closely yourself & check your double standards at the door. I am speaking of editing my criticisms of your actions amongst other things.

I did not start an """"edit war"""" as you imply. Your issue was personaldisobedience to be exact, with a sprinkling of that self empowering sparkle which lording over others endowsthe joy of duct tape & racquetball, which only a cop-at-heart can understand. I did not practice deception as you imply with the """"sock puppet"""", I signed my name to every puppets comment. I am not a perp, as implied by your actions in sum. Therefore you are barking up the wrong tree. I don't buy it that you are a robot bound to regs just doing your job as implied; you are a person making choices & you chose bad faith & laziness.

The generalisms you sincerely & patiently list, I'm sure are relevant in the wider context & larger community that you refer to & I'm sure what you do is of value there. I don't envy your job. In this case, however, we're talking two people debating in a forum, & an article that needs to be kept safe & sterile from any potential change lest something terrible happen! Is the cop/citizen ratio so mature in this community that there are resources to police such minor quibbles? Where am I Disneyland? Tracking IP's attached to names in order to reign in such terrorism is downright dumb for a supposedly progressive community. See WP WTF

I will continue to do what I can to fix it, with or without your rules if it's important to you that you stand in my way.

They might have been slightly incivil - but certainly true.

Now I understand that there are many conservatives that support Bush, the Iraq War, or other Bush Administration policies.

Free Republic is another one of these blog sites, a right-wing one, but it’s different from the others, mainly because these people aren’t conservatives, nor are they neoconservatives. They are complete and total fascists. They abhor, though they won’t admit it, every value America was founded on. The moderator and founder, Jim Robinson, deletes any post that contradicts the opinion of himself, his members, and the Bush Administration.

Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism

By lsanger in Op-Ed
Fri Dec 31, 2004 at 12:42:24 AM EST
Tags: Internet (all tags) TABInternet
TAB

Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including """"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia"""" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as """"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive"""".

These articles are written by people who appear not to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully. I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)

Wikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.

TAB
TAB
Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.

First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.

My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.

You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?

I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.

Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.

Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.

Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

A tag has been placed on Chen Yue requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Oblivion(Novel) 

The last book reveals Jamie ended up in Saint Boltoph's Church in Boston, England. The other four Gatekeepers are scattered around the world, with Scarlett and Richard Cole ending up in Giza, Egypt. Matt and Lohan Shan-Tung end up in the Basilica de Nossa Senhore de Nazare in Belem, Brazil and Pedro and Scott ended up in the Abbey of San Galgano in Italy.
Ten years have passed since the destruction of Hong Kong, and the Old Ones have revealed themselves to the world, as the war is slowly destroying humanity, and, as predicted, humanity forms a resistance to them, the """"World Army."""" Baker, President of the United States, is opposing this resistance, leading to all out warfare with rebels and government forces. Behind it all are the Old Ones, manipulating events from Antarctica, where they draw humanity with promise of easy victory when in reality Matt has a vision revealing the resistance's defeat. He tries to warn the resistance's leader.
Scott is converted to the Old Ones and lures Matt and Richard into captivity. Richard works out the purpose of the tumi Inca knife and plunges it into Matt, killing his present form but bringing his past form 10000 years into the future to continue the fight. Scott soon regrets his decision and in a final act of repentance reopens the doors, allowing the others to travel to Antarctica, but in the process killing himself. His past form travels to the future along with Matt's and the five are able to defeat the Old Ones once and for all.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Comment.  The nomenclature on Wikipedia seems to be to use the word """"painters"""" to describe fine artists whose medium is paint.  Category: Painters and its subcategories, and virtually all its subcats and daughter articles use the word """"painter"""" with that meaning.

""""Mine is the true revolutionary method. If the people of the empire refuse, as I believe they should refuse, to render military service - if they decline to pay taxes to support that instrument of violence, an army - the present system of government cannot stand."""" - Tolstoy

RJ11, in the quote you gave, Tolstoy answered, """"No; he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes.""""  So he did support tax resistence.  I think you have misunderstood the rest of the quote due to the non-standard use (or translation from Russian?) of the word """"resist."""" (which is understandable, unless you'd read the book.)  In """"The Kingdom..."""" the word """"resist"""" means the use of violence or evil.  I.e. chapter 1 title: """"THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE..."""".  Then he quote William Lloyd Garrison and Ballou:

Q. Ought the word """"non-resistance"""" to be taken in its widest  sensethat is to say, as intending that we should not offer  any resistance of any kind to evil?

A. No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's  teachingthat is, not repaying evil for evil. We ought to  oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by  evil.

 I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading.  See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte:
 Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points.  In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)
 The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area).  If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  

 On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself.  98.218.195.90  12:41, 6 July 2010",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Article Evaluation 
For this assignment, I was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about Change Management. The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. 
The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. 
The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. 
Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding (as ITAQALLAH laments """"but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy, and ignores any policies that I may cite"""") why this article deserves to be deleted, I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts.

The article (in its post-censorsed state) is in violation of WP:BLP.
Let me quote from it: 

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page. Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies, especially:

 Neutral point of view (NPOV)
 Verifiability
 No original research

This article violates requirement number One: Neutral point of view (NPOV)

Now for idiotic editors (like those who childishly colour their usernames) who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV (owing to their idiocy, which I hope Eugenics will fix one day) let me quote section 2.5 from the NPOV page:

Balance

When reputable sources contradict one another, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.

It says """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""". And where does this article do that ???
Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints, it suppresses opposing viewpoints.

This is why the article is biased, censorsed and therefore must be deleted.

I will be re-inserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""" requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored. -   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Personal attack??!! 

I didn't attack you. I just corrected one small edit you had made. It isn't accurate to write """"GNR (Portuguese police)"""" because GNR, a National Guard or gendarmerie (a military body charged with police duties among civilian populations), is usually known as the Guard (Guarda) and the designation """"police"""" is almost always used for the PSP - Polícia de Segurança Pública. Finally, the PJ - Polícia Judiciária is known as the Judiciária. I didn't know we can't use the """"undo"""" button - if that was what you tried to say to me. Cheers.  

Sorry I am a bit stressed, I do know gendarmerie is a french word but your new edit was cool. Perhaps I am getting stressed cos I dont like the Portuguese police and judiciary and feel desperately sorry for the McCaan's (my own dislike is personal and as far as that isnt acceptable here at least I am admitting my prejudice), I see you are Portuguese or at least a native speaker,  

edit warring

And stop accusing editors in good standing of """"trolling"""".  Take a break, SqueakBox.  You're too experienced and too good an editor to behave like this.   

Removing a POV tag is trolling, adding it isnt, simple as that. And templating the regualrsd is not acceptabl;e, donmt do it again,   
Dude, your spelling is atrocious, your attitude bizarre, and your behavior intolerable.  Seriously - I know you're better than this as I've seen you around quite a bit.  You're obviously not yourself tonight.  TAKE A BREAK.   
And this dispute has now been (erroneously, IMHO) posted on ANI. (   

Spelling. That's so 20th Century, its called typos and it has nothing to do with spelling. All I want is for the NPOV tag to stay, its a reasonable request and its not asking too much as the article is POV. Best wishes. Cheers for the heads up re AN/I,  
Bah.  Spelling is important when the medium being used is written. )
I don't understand why you are insisting on having a separate NPOV template instead of allowing the issue to be noted in the """"Multiple issues"""" template that is already in the article.  Can you please explain?   

Oh I dont doubt the importance of spelling, its typing I find difficult. This article is so POV, I do intend to seek out some other refs but NPOV demands both sides are prevsented and as I made clear on the talk that isnt happening in this article. That some rascist editors are targetting it (eg the banned fourdee) is ample evidence of that. I am baffled as to why anyone would remove the NPOV tag, I never do that before resolving the issue,  
Please answer the question: Why do you insist on a separate NPOV template when the other one communicates the exact same idea but with less clutter?   

I removed the blue tag. I want the orange tag there and I have fully explained my reasons. The article presents one side of an argument and not the other. I dont understand what the controversy is as I removed the unnotable blue tag,  
No, I'm afraid that you haven't answered the question.  I don't see a need to for multiple templates when one easily suffices.   
Nor do I. That is why I have removed the blue tag. An orange NPOV tag was created for a reason and it should stay as an orange tag. What is the problem? Anyway I see others are now edit  warring, i wont touch the article till teoimorrow but gibvenm editors like fourdee have edited the article its POV status is inevitable,  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals.

By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold.

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour ..... 

clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

Speedy deletion of Andrew takao
 A tag has been placed on Andrew takao requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Re: Friends episodes articles.
I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles.  I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well.
As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.  As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job.

Definition of islamophobia
I think the root cause of problems is the disagreeance between Axon and me about the definition of islamophobia. Axon wants the Runnymede Trust definition of islamophobia to be held as universally valid, while I want the dictionary definition to be used. 
Axon and other users argue that because the Runnymede Trust definition for islamophobia is supported by """"a wide range of international bodies and governments"""", it is universally valid.

Dictionary definition of islamophobia: 
Prejudice against Islam and Muslims.

Runnymede Trust Definition of islamophobia:
Islam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change. 
Islam is seen as separate and 'other'. It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them. 
Islam is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist. 
Islam is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of terrorism and engaged in a 'clash of civilisations'. 
Islam is seen as a political ideology and is used for political or military advantage. 
Criticisms made of the West by Islam are rejected out of hand. 
Hostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society. 
Anti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural or normal. 

I and other users argue that the Runnymede Trust Definition has severe logical and factual fallacies and that the Runnymede Trust is not a neutral and impartial source.

4533,"About the “Adrian Ettlinger” Article 

Hi Mr. Ettlinger,

your thanks notification regarding my edit to the Adrian Ettlinger article (whom I believe is about your late father) is appreciated. I'm not quite sure what is how a notification is better than an edit to the user talk page, but I still appreciate it. I tried to reach you on Twitter (see my tweets in this conversation) but I don't appear to have got a reply. I'm glad to see you're on the Wikipedia as well. I'm sorry for the loss of your father.

In any case, my name is Shlomi Fish (User:Shlomif) and I'm an Israeli software developer and writer (born in 1977) who was introduced to your father when I initiated a (successful) attempt to integrate my solver for Freecell into the Freecell Pro program that he originated and still maintained back then, and we ended up exchanging several hundreds of E-mails and became friends, and later continued discussing various topics after the technical goal was achieved. I still kept most of the E-mail messages from him (although I'm not sure I have all of my own replies), and was sorry to have learned about him passing away (which I did after doing a web search by accident).

Anyway, I'd like to post some of the E-mails he sent me (or at least selected parts thereof) as a way to commemorate him, but they may need to be filtered to avoid speaking against him and other people (he also told me about his family (children, grandchildren, etc.) and friends. I also want to translate (from Hebrew to English) a story I originally wrote about my Internet relationship with Adrian (see this link - not sure what Google Translate and similar services can make of it for now) for an online Israeli story contest for the Software Freedom Day, which had a focus on open source software development (I don't think I hoped to win, but I wanted to do my share for the event). The story was written back when Adrian was still alive, and we exchanged E-mails for several years after that.

I'll appreciate it if you can return to me, and sorry for this being so long (you may be quite busy). I'm sorry again for your loss.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

p.xxii =Though Peter’s name has now become powerful, he may not be as historical as we think he is, and the role we attribute to him may possibily be an amalgam of that of several individuals by the same name, one a martyred ‘cousin’ of both Jesus and James and their reputed successor in Palestine, Simeon bar Cleophas.’

p.143‘It is possible that the Cephas being referred to in between the references to ‘Peter’ in Paul’s letters is another ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – the Simeon bar Cleophas mentioned above as Jesus’ first cousin. Just as Simon Peter in Scripture is represented as being the successor to Jesus, this Simon or Simeon is represented by early Church tradition as being the successor to James. He is also of the family of Jesus, Cleophas being specifically denoted as the uncle of Jesus.’

BUT

p.143 ‘As we proceed, it will probably transpire that this Cleophas is not the uncle of Jesus, but rather his father, and there are traditions that to some degree represent him as such. In John 19:25, for instance, he is represented as the husband of Mary and this is probably true’ etc.

p.318 ‘the picture in early Church sources of the words of James’ successor Simeon bar Cleophas, the ‘Rechabite Priest’, who rebukes those stoning James the Just.'

p.324 ‘the election of Simeon by universal consent as ‘Bishop’ of the Church’ .- the restriction to ‘Jerusalem’ this time dropped.’

p.394 ‘Eusebius . .when discussing the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James as ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ or ‘Second Bishop’ of the early Church. Since Jerusalem was by this time in ruins, it is difficult to see Simeon simply as second Bishop of Jerusalem. (Whether Simeon is the cousin germane of Jesus, as Eusebius puts it, or the second or third brother of Jesus – also ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – will be discussed later.)

p.416 ‘Eusebius retains Hegesippus’ internal references, even though at this point he does not enumerate what these sects were. He does in a later passage where his note about the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James for some reason triggers a discussion of Hegesippus’ life.’

pp.468-9 (a) ‘Suppose we were to say, as also concluded above, that by ‘Rechabite’ Eusebius was trying to same something similar to ‘Essene’, ‘Nazirite’, or ‘Ebionite’; then out of this band of Essene or Ebionite ‘Priests’, one, James’  ‘cousin’ and successor, Simeon bar Cleophas, emerged as the next ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ in Palestine (only, after the fall of the Temple and Jerusalem, there clearly was no ‘Jerusalem Community’ any longer to speak of).’

(b) ‘If we now superimpose the story of the stoning of Stephen from Acts upon the story of the stoning of James from Epiphanious and Eusebius, then Simeon Bar Cleophas or the Rechabite Priestly ‘witness’ becomes James’ (and presumably Simeon’s) ideological adversary Paul . . Paul takes the place of his opposite number, James’ successor in Palestine, Simeon bar Cleophas – the only difference being that while one approves the other disapproves of what was done.’

For the record, this Indian boy is a troll or was trolling for fire (BR, this reminds me of OH-6 flying low deliberately to draw for enemy fire), look at his comment and you'll see. Note that I have a very low tolerance for trolls and vandal, so as such I have been the target of such imbeciles from the start of my wiki-career. BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secret-admirer/stalker/impostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editor(s) who harass me while imposting as me, what I'm doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor to latch on his tail instead. Yes, I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but I'm not stupid. Him, on the other hand, is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor reacts to him. What are we to do then? Lastly, the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date (end of our one month mutual interaction ban) to revert my edit so I'm fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronic/insensitive jerk, especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert. Tell me now, does it take two hands or one to clap? In honour of that interaction ban, I've stayed away from him for one whole month (to the letter and the spirit of the law that requires of me but he did so only to the letter) and yet at the end of it, he has the galls to come pick on my edit? Come on, how oxymoron can that be that he is indeed trolling by all account? And both times, he goes to ANI, he doesn't have the courtesy to post an ANI-notice on my page, tell me now if that is not trolling? Forgetting twice?

 Parting thoughts on Jmh649 RFAR 
This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can """"adjust""""? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf.

I'm not sure where you're located or what you know about the history of the Pacific Northwest, or how much of the particular special lexicon around here you  may be aware of.  But let me tell you this, really loud and clear -= a certain warm wet southwesterly, typically days in duration, is called a Chinook by fishermen, sailors, ferry crews, loggers and yes the weathermen, who use the term as part of the loca argot in the same way they commonly use """"out on the chuck"""" meaning """"out on the water"""" (and that's not in Canadian meteorologic usages either).  The media in this case are not incorrect, but rather using the existing local tgerminology, often kinda proudly (as also with the saltchuck/chuck references); it's not the first time that standard Canadian usages are completely clueless or heedless of British Columbian usage.  It may not in fact be the same wind, there being in the old days no way to call what is now Alberta and let 'em know the tropical air mass was on its way over; all I know is the term IS part of the marine and weather lexicons in BCand, at least, in Whatcom County (where KVOS-TV 12 is, one of the stations who use the term).  As fort the directional thing, it's pretty clear with the Prairie version of the wind that the direction """"from the country ofthe Chinooks"""" IS the origin, especially when you consdier that the fur traders' HQ on the Pacific Slope was in Chinook territory (Fort Vancouver).  The directional thing on the coast is clear if you've ever seen a satellite video of a Chinook, which looks like a big thick band of white cloud streaming in from the general direction of Hawaii, but more specifically SSW even SSWxS, pretty much in a line over the Olympic Peninsula, Greater Victoria, andheadingto into Greater Vancouver from the direction of Tsawswassen, which incientally if you draw back in scale you can see is also roughly the direction of the mouth of hte Coluymbia, i.e. the coujntry of the Chinooks.  But compass-exact directions aren't hte issue, nautical ones are.  And it so happens that Chinooks arriving in Nuu-chahb-nuolth teritory would be coming from the southwest, i.e. around C ape Flattery, but nobody in those days was splitting hairs like you are; they came to use the term Chinook to mean a warm wet wind from that general direction.  The same as Squamish (wind) means a cold, harsh northerly outflow wind, which in the Georgai Strait/nortthern Puget Sound happens to be from the north and the direction of the country of the Skxwu7mesh people at what is now the town of Squamish.  Anyway, aside from all that, I've vgot requests in to Gobal, CBCand other weriters I know of hoping for a proper cite or at least a news item from the vancouver sun.  I don't care about your objections, you're just plain wrong.  And if Canadian meteorologic usage hasnt' included this term, it's their fault, not those of the BC broadcasters who still use it (""""still"""" because it dates back to the old days); it's nopt the first time that Canadian publications of any kiknd have omitted BC  perspectives or simply gotten things all wrong.  And if you ask a Chinook person, you'll find out that the correct pronunciation of the original word IS """"Tshinuk""""; the Albertan prononciation is a frenchified affectation..

 Wapipedia 

Anyone here use it (http://wapipedia.org)? I'm kind of new to it, and there doesn't seem to be a talk/editing facility. So I'm going to post this here, hope that's okay. Their article on the Prophet Mohammed includes the following text:

By his own standards, the continuing traditions of social justice in the Islamic World, of methods and knowledge of science, history and medicine as they evolved in the modern world (thanks to his profound influence driving Muslims to literacy and inquiry), and the prayers of over one billion Muslims, many of whom pray for him five times a day (or attach """" peace be upon him"""" after each mention of his name), render Muhammad arguably the most influential man in all history, an honour often reserved for Jesus in the West. Even those historians who have deplored his influence and considered it to have retarded the growth of its chief rival faith, Christianity, express grudging admiration for the man.

and this:

To the traitors inside Medina it must have come as a surprise when the 10,000-strong force of Abu Sufyan failed to cross a trench dug around Medina by order of Muhammad, as the Persian scribe Salman e-Farsi had suggested to him. After the retreat of Abu Sufyan and his forces, the Muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the Charter of Medina. The munafiqun quickly crumbled, and their leader Abd Allah ibn Ubayy pledged allegiance to Muhammad. The Muslims then besieged the Banu Qurayza, who had intrigued against them. They had the opportunity of choosing Muhammad as an arbitrator, but instead the Banu Qurayza chose Saad ibn Muadh, the leader of their former allies, the Aus.

And this is its take on the Battle of Badr, 624 CE, which is markedly different to that found in the Wikipedia article (which raises doubts about the aftermath of the battle): 

On March 15, 624 near a place called Badr, the two forces clashed. Though outnumbered 800 to 300 in the battle, the Muslims met with success, killing at least 45 Makkans, including Abu Jahl, and taking 70 prisoners; whereas only 14 Muslims died. To the Muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of Muhammad's prophethood, and he and all the Muslims rejoiced greatly. Following this victory, assassinations eliminated Medinans who had satirized Muhammad, and the victors expelled a hostile Jewish clan. Virtually all the remaining Medinans converted and Muhammad became de facto ruler of the city.

...as is Dallas (Alien), but when I saw Film, and a character, I added, although I'd looked for a  Book/Novel section, I overlooked see Dallas (name) further down. Would you agree that Film should be changed to Films, and the other named character removed as well?   

Perhaps. Generally, if something is commonly known as exactly """"Dallas"""", that should be listed on the disambiguation page. People (or characters) with the given name or surname may be moved to a separate page as they are partial title matches. That would suggest that Dallas (Alien) should remain on the disambiguation page. But the page could perhaps be reorganized to make it easier to use. Perhaps a section for == People and character == with entries for Dallas (name) and Dallas (Alien) (sometimes a hiddden comment is added to remind editors to only add an entry if it is known as exactly the term being disambiguated).  ≠ wiser

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek.

What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?""""

 Anti-Semitism? I'm outta here! 

Archangel White Tiger:

A few words, meow:

Oh, so I was banned for quoting the Torah! Excellent, the admins here are banning for """"personal attack on gays"""", when you recite The Words of The G-d, but no one was banned for saying, that holocaust victims were gays and gypsies! More than six million people died in holocaust just because they were Jews, the statement at which I got angered is was of accusing martyrs in concentration camps in sodomy, which IS one of the greatest sins, according to BIBLE - Old Testament, TaNaKh and the New Testament, B’rit Chadashah of Messiah Yeshua Ben Elochim, Jesus Christ the Son of G-d, that Ta Bu Shi Da Yu never tried to read... These are pure actions of anti-Semitic and Heretic propaganda, some sort of modern faschism...

 *** ***

For the last words (and I'm outta here) I will recite Bible... The reason I was banned is for """"surely"""" confirming these Words:

Leviticus 20:13

""""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.""""

 *** ***

And this will be my good-bye to all nazis here: ;)

There is no requirement that a featured article be longish such as Retreat of glaciers since 1850 is...in fact, there are many articles that are quite short that are also featured.

I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that.
However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works. 
All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.  
And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪

I thought fashionistas would appreciate the added info about Pucci's roman salon, and I was captivated by her interesting eyes and I thought she was a cool persaonality to talk about, since I was already writing about similar topics and had the sources available.

We are having a discussion here about starting a list of former DYK articles that have become good or featured content, and the way we're going about it is by placing such articles into Category:Wikipedia Did you know articles that are featured articles or Category:Wikipedia Did you know articles that are good articles by adding that text in a parser function within the  credit template that goes on article talk pages.  Dr pda, though, just pointed out that a lot of FAs don't have the  template on the talk page anymore, to avoid talkpage clutter, and instead have the DYK mentioned in , meaning that if we wanted to go forward with this we would probably have to add some code in  to put the talkpage into one of those categories if  has both DYK and GA/FC.  Dr pda said that you're the person to ask about this template, so I was just wondering if you would have an estimate of how much work it might be to make this happen, and whether or not it would cause problems with other things.

Hi sorry if the removal was a problem it's that this is a childs programme which offered no gay suggestion and was sexless in so far as apart from friendships between the characters there was no hint as to sexuality. indeed they are supposed to be children themselves and to suggest sexuality is treading on thin ice.
1/ To quote a letter as a source is poor at best, i could write an outrageous letter myself and quote it here but it wouldn't make it right.

2/ This has been denied and moreover was a misunderstanding by the press who blew 'what if' questions out of all proportion. see link please http://www.salon.com/news/1999/02/13newsb.html

2 and a half... I find the notion that a mention of a tea cup storm made by small minded individuals should be included in a pen picture of a childrens TV show ludicrous at best but this comment is the only just comment with real founding.

3/ The outcome should be entered as i find it hard to believe it ever got to a courtroom.

1/ [edit] Tinky-Winky controversy
One of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, was the focus of a still hinted-at controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's purse (although he was first """"outed"""" by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to The Face).

2/ A February, 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal, published by Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, saying """"he is purple—the gay pride color, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle—the gay pride symbol.""""

2(and a half!) A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., who licenses the characters in the United States, said it was just a magic bag. """"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish.""""

3/ In an incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said """"I got a gun"""". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., claimed the toy acutally said """"Again, Again"""". [3]

Can this section be removed on the grounds that it really has no worth and is trying to portray child characters as gay. Especially while using hinted and possibly.

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

 An open letter from the Wikipedia Review 

This is a message to Beam,

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch. WE call the shots. WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now?

The point the article makes is that different names are used: popular language calls this thing """"singular they"""", linguists call it """"plural anaphoric they"""". Sure, it's the same thing.
I'm not sure where you get the idea of indeterminate number """"shifting"""" to indeterminate gender. I, for one, agree with you, there is no such """"shift"""" in English (unless it lies a long way back in the history of English pronouns, but that's another, and long, story). The article, however, at least as I read it, also agrees with us. It asserts there are two types of indeterminacy, either or both of which can be marked by use of they. Where does it say one """"shifts"""" into the other?
Regarding your sentences, you have constructed them such that all have indeterminate gender. The first, however, could clearly apply to 0, 1 or >=2 people, so also has indeterminate number (or is plural, per Givón). The key thing is that all your sentences involve universal quantification over the domain (or restriction) of a variable: for all people or students x in X, your sentences assert something that is true for person or student x. Because there is a plurality of x in X, Givón and other liguists, call usage of they, in constructions such as yours, plural. Because each x is a singular person (in the first sentence a hypothetical person), ordinary people, like you and me, call this usage """"singular"""". In fact, though, these constructions are distributive (one assertion to each of many people), which is why grammatical number cannot be well defined. There is no specific reference, so singularity or plurality can't be derived from a referent in the usual way. The constructions have either generic reference, or no reference at all.

Let us (at least me), we the ones that don't have the power of moderators, let us uphold reason and above all truth of facts and reality, that this pig by the name of Fidel Castro is not only a communist criminal but is a devil in its own right.

 ::: Ah,but you said that you would.I am holding you to your word.If you want to chicken out now it's ok by me.You are claiming there is a consensus about a complex bit of proof which you refuse to reveal.
 ::: And we are not going to pay another one of those Comrade Stalin rules bit.There is no other discussion page on the entire Wickie where a rent a mob plays the games that are played on this subject.
 ::: Yes,I am always honored to have students write to me.I never had a letter from a post-Modernist University before, though I got quite a few from Duke students when the infamous gang of """"88"""" Duke academics(the numbers actually varied from 134 to 40 something)were trying(quite literally) to lynch members of the the Lacrosse team.
That was a real  academic consensus,Paul!Much better than any evidence of a consensus about Pericles!It included(still does) Huston Baker former president of PMLA,and Karla Holloway,who was rewarded for her behavior by a temporary lectureship at Harvard. In fact it included the entire English department with the exception(of course) of the anti-Strat(horrors personal research).
 ::: No, this type of concensus doesn't disturb me or those for whom I write and,I am ever enheartened to find new proof,that such a Marxist view of concensus it isn't intimidating the young.The reasons why William Shakspere is ,in all probability, a fraud are exactly the same type of reasons that Crystal Mangum was raped by thee,five,fifteen or thirty members of the Duke Lacrosse team.Forstarters you can't fit a thosand pounds of flesh(Crystal's minimum figure) into a nineteen forty, two by four,john.
 ::: Nevertheless,the overwhelming concensus of the Duke English faculty,one lone anti-Strat dissenting,is that it did happen.And I see no reason why if the Wickie rules which you invoke are consistently applied,that the Duke Lacrosse Hoax should not be revised accordingly.
 :::Or let's take another example here:Wickie's admirable treatment of the Alger Hiss case,a trial which I have followed, blow by blow, since the 1950's.It states correctly that there is almost a consensus as to Hiss's guilt among the present generation of American historians.(Not I suspect true of British or Eastern bloc historians)
But it, admirably, goes on to list some twenty reasons(with footnotes)demostrating why there are the most serious reasons(some of them physical as in the Duke case) for disbelieving that """"consensus"""".This constitutes a minimum of what both the young aand the old have a right to expect of the Shakespeare discussions.

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith.

I just added this section because someone badly needs to update this completely obsolete article. Because of the well-cited 2006 article below, pretty much all the criticisms in this Wikipedia article are out of touch. The readers will be grateful to anyone who will update it - but the amount of required work is nontrivial.

Many of the doubts about the theory disappeared in 2006 when Gerard Roe published a paper, In defense of Milankovitch, in Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 33, L24703, doi:10.1029/2006GL027817, 2006.  He correctly identified the insolation with the time-derivative of the measured ice volume, rather than the ice volume itself, and obtained a spectacular agreement that has solved the 100,000-year problem and other problems below. By taking the derivative, the short-duration, higher-frequency cycles are amplified.

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk 
The reason seems pretty obvious to me: """"fart"""" is a much rougher, less """"refined"""" word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -  (Talk at me) 

 Citations needed 

Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section """"Dietary"""" where every second word has a citation or """"citation needed"""". Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!217.231.205.126  
I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know. 74.56.36.34  

 ICD infobox 

Why is this article topped by a medical infobox? In the vast majority of occurances, flatulence has nothing to do with either disease or dysfunction.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Here is the original Arabic text from Ibn Baz's official website 

""""وبلغ أمير الأحساء وتوابعها من بني خالد سليمان ابن عريعر الخالدي أمر الشيخ، وأنه يدعو إلى الله، وأنه يهدم القباب، وأنه يقيم الحدود، فعظم على هذا البدوي أمر الشيخ، لأن من عادة البادية -إلا من هدى الله- الإقدام على الظلم، وسفك الدماء، ونهب الأموال، وانتهاك الحرمات، فخاف أن هذا الشيخ يعظم أمره، ويزيل سلطان الأمير البدوي، فكتب إلى عثمان يتوعده، ويأمره أن يقتل هذا المطوع الذي عنده في العيينة، وقال: إن المطوع الذي عندكم بلغنا عنه كذا، وكذا!! فإما أن تقتله، وإما أن نقطع عنك خراجك الذي عندنا.!! وكان عنده للأمير عثمان خراج من الذهب، فعظم على عثمان أمر هذا الأمير، وخاف إن عصاه أن يقطع عنه خراجه أو يحاربه""""

And this is how it translates (punch it into an automatated translator or show it to a friend if you don't believe it):

""""And news of the Shaikh reached the emir of al-Ahsa and its dependencies from Bani Khalid, Sulaiman ibn 'Uray;ir al-Khaldi, and it came to his knowledge that he called to God, and that he brought down the domes, and that he instituted the hudud [punishments], and so the matter of the Shaikh disturbed this bedouin, for it is the habit of the bedouin - except those whom God has guided - to rush to commit injustice, bloodshed, expropriation, and violation of prohibitions, so he feared that the power of this Shaikh may increase and do away with the power of the bedouin prince.  And so he wrote to Uthman, threatening him, and ordered him that he must kill this mutawwa that is with him at 'Uyayna, and said: 'this mutawwa that is with you, such and such has come to our knowledge about him!!  Either you kill him, or we cut off the dividend that you have with us', for the emir Uthman had [an annual] dividend of gold in the custody of [al-Khaldi].""""

No comment.

Now, I haven't been able to find a trace of the English version of this book online, but I would really appreciate it if you could confirm that it actually introduces the word """"Shi'ite"""" in there.  If it does, then I would love to find out where I may find a copy, or at least what government ministry is in charge of printing it, because I would like to post the info on the Bani Khalid's official website so that they could file a complaint and have this error rectified.

 Proposed revision of the controversy section 

Though controversy shouldn't consume the bulk of the article, I think the revised section is somewhat awkwardly written and neglects the substance of the criticisms. It can be rewritten for greater clarity, and to include the quotes that have actually generated the controversy. It is just false to say conservative bloggers are basing their criticisms on """"a single line from his book""""but if it were true, shouldn't that line be quoted too? The section can be kept short, while not excluding the content of criticisms. I propose the following text.

Lloyd has been targeted by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, with the aim of forcing him to resign, as happened with former White House adviser Van Jones.

Beck broadcast a video of Lloyd's comments at a 2008 conference on media reform, in which he described the rise of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as """"really an incredible revolution."""" Conservatives view this as an expression of support for Chavez, though Lloyd has stated that he does not support him. Conservative bloggers have also attacked Lloyd's commitment to free speech, based largely on quotes from his book Prologue to a Farce: Communication and Democracy in America, in which he writes that the First Amendment should be placed """"in context with other communications policies,"""" and on his 2007 article Forget The Fairness Doctrine, discussing """"clear proposals...to address the gap between conservative and progressive talk."""" Over 50 non-partisan public interest groups have defended Lloyd, calling conservative claims """"false and misleading.""""

This is only about 30 words longer than the present version, but I believe it does much more to inform readers about the controversy. Since the controversy section of this article is so controversial, however, I'll leave my rewrite here for a day or two before implementing it. It's always easier to see bias against your own point of view, so I hope some liberals can improve on my text!

Happy to add some references and beef up the text when I get chance. But here's one quote from Ratzinger which comes directly before the quotre about it being a"""" fundamental threat to the church.""""

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

This is a very bad thing for a pilot to do at any time, and a cardinal sin when done 30 ft above the ground. The evidence is clear – the plane was at alphamax (high angle of attack), at very low airspeed, and with engine set to idle. Asseline has nobody else to blame for putting the plane into such a dangerous configuration, he was in command. All the other distracting issues, eg. precise altitude, wearing a headset, engine lag in responding to throttle-up command, etc etc, are little more than red herrings because none of them excuse the fact that the plane stalled due to pilot error.

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Hello Danny, here is a reply to your post on my talk page; you said:

""""A Question. Central, can you explain something to me? You obviously don't like JWs so why do you spend so much time thinking about us? Personally, I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset. Yet I notice that JWs and related articles are the only subject you deal with on WP. I doesn't [sic] make any sense to me at all - what's up with that! As it says on the WP main page, """"In this English version, started in 2001, we are currently working on 730,275 articles."""" Wouldn't you be happier branching out to some of the other subjects on WP. Just a thought. DannyMuse """"

Ho hum, here we go. . . I see your inevitable desire to posit straw men has taken the better of you again (yawn). You stated: """"You obviously don't like JWs. . ."""" Actually Danny I have some friends who are JWs, and I have no problem with them as individual per se. If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders, not JWs. Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation. 

Your second reality admittance is very revealing, you said: """"I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset."""" You sure do Danny, as do most JWs, and don't think it hasn't been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages. Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the """"channel of God"""", and """"the only narrow road to salvation"""", shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you don't like. This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions, they just look away when reality comes knocking. This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through self-deception. Danny, never underestimate the power of denial, it will steal all your relationship with God, and you will probably let that happen.

Danny, I will not argue with you, as you are not ready to see reality at present, I pray one day you will be able, but maybe that time is not yet. I will leave it with God, if he wants you, he will open your eyes. Until then, I will leave you with some advice from your own organisation; on this occasion, you should take that advice. Regards, , 15 September 2005

""""Even some religious people have closed minds. They are interested only in """"their"""" religion, showing no willingness to as much as listen to the views of others. And even though they may not have chosen their religion but simply have inherited it from their parents, still they feel that their religion must be right. But not every inheritance is necessarily good. . . What makes a religion right is its total adherence to God's Word. Whether our religion meets this criterion or not can only be determined by open-mindedly comparing it with the Bible. . Why, some people have even been known to doubt the truthfulness of a message simply on the basis of where the message bearer came from . . An open mind is willing to do what 1 John 4:1 recommends. It says: """"Beloved ones, do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.""""—Awake! 22 November 1984  pp.8-10

""""If you find that a doctrine or teaching is a lie, you should quickly forsake it, regardless of who teaches it or how long you have believed that teaching to be true.

 Trying to measure the number of cafes 

This is one of those places where I am so frustrated by Wikipedia's ban on original research. The article has the absurdly low """"at least six cafes on the Ave or its alleys"""". I don't know where that number comes from, nor what they consider a """"cafe"""", but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition, the scene includes:
 Solstice
 Cafe Zoe
 The original Allegro (on an alley parallel to the Ave); arguably, its second location in the College Inn also counts
 The Ugly Mug (half block off)
 The Cafe at the corner of 42nd that used to be the Roma, but I can't recall its new name
 Sureshot
 The Continental
 Caffe Apassionato

 Pochi Tea
 Gingko Tea House
 Tully's 
 Starbucks
 Wannabee (one block off)
 Still Life on the Ave (at the Grand Illusion); technically, the entrance is around the corner, but it is clearly effectively on the Ave.

This doesn't even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints, nor does it count things like U.

For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.

The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged.

Boy, this is the most understated thing I've read here on Wikipedia.  While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.

In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the """"Mormons"""" and the """"Gentiles"""" during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.

Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.

The Bridge on the Drina by Ivo Andric, Univeristy of Chicago Press 1977

Translator's foreword by Lovett F. Edwards, page 7: Dr Ivo Andric is himself a Serb and a Bosnian

Introduction by William H. McNeil, page 3:They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, ..., The family was Orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb;

and in the

The Nobel Prize in Literature 1961 Presentation Speech by Anders Österling, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy - As a young Serbian student, he joined the national revolutionary movement, suffered persecution, and was imprisoned in 1914 when the war broke out. 

which shall have place in his biography for knowing that the book translator Edwards and the world-renown historian McNeil were close Ivo's friends. Both biographical notes were written in the first edition of this Ivo's book in 1959 and the biographical data are coming from the very Ivo.

Anders Österling's Presentation Speech during the official ceremony 1961 in Sweden and in the Andric's presence - gives the undeniable credibility to biographical data heard in this speech. - 

As to the Clasification paragraph - it has nothing to do with biography - just a slander and disrespect of this great writer. My proposal - delete it completely. 

From the above discussion - is visible that Andric rejected idea to be seen as of Croatian lineage

When Krleza attempted to allign Ivo with Croats - Ivo responded this way

 Enes Cengic; """"Krleza post mortem"""",  I-III. Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1990. 2. part, pages 171-172

 """" Medjutim, s tekstom o Andricu za staru Enciklopediju stvari su tekle ovako:
 Tekst je napisao Milan Bogdanovic i poslao ga meni na imprimatur, kao biva, da li ga primam  ili ne.
 Kao ni mnoge druge tekstove,  vjerovali vi sad meni ili ne ... ja tekst o Andricu nisam citao. 
 Mislio sam: Neka pise sto hoce, tako cemo to i objaviti. Ionako  je bilo iznad moje moci da tu ista 
 diram i ispravljam. Mjesec ili ne znam koliko nakon sto mi je poslao tekst, primim od Milana pismo 
 u kojem mi kaze da je kopiju teksta dao Ivi Andricu na uvid te da on moli da budem ljubazan i da u 
 tekstu nesto izmijenim, a to je:

 Ivo Andric, rodjen u Travniku 10.10.1892. godine, hrvatskog porijekla, zavrsio skole itd.... Moli 
 me da brisem da je hrvatskog porijekla. Na to odgovaram Bogdanovicu (oprostite sto citiram):
     
 Dragi moj Milane,

 Pozdravi Ivu Andrica u moje ime, veoma srdacno,i poruci mu, ako mozes, da mu ja jebem hrvatsku
 majku, brisat cu da je hrvatskog  porijekla."""" 

Shortly, Milan Bogdanovic wrote a text of Andric's biography, presented a copy of this text to Andric. Andric asked Bogdanovic to remove the note saying that he (Ivo) was a man of Croatian lineage.

You think the video you gave proves anything? You ended up contradicting yourself.

 GA review 

After going through the article I feel that it meets the GA criteria and I have decided to pass it. I have fixed up spelling errors and redirects as I read through it. The only way I feel this article could be better was if it contained more current information on Psaltis and also if her ring name in the infobox should still be in boldface, because bold should only be used if the person is still wrestling. If she is, perhaps include some information about that but if not then the name should not be in boldface.

Information needing to be inserted into the article
The translation needs to be continued, and the result wikified and styled. Taken from here. Moved here because Markstreet reverted the article for the 15th time, and I already reverted two times. 

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?'

But thank you, truly.  I count many editors here as friends, but I feel as though our association has an added depth to it (perhaps because we've met in person...perhaps because we so often find each other saying what we would have said)  it's hard to tell you how glad I am to have your respect and your encouragement.  It's been a good thing to take a couple of months off and breathe the outside air a bit, and it's been especially nice (forgive my selfishness, if you will) to know that I can do that and trust that you (and a few other trusted souls) will fight the fires I had run out of energy to do anything about.  You really do exceptional work.  If someday there is a book that seeks to explain Wikipedia's exceptional growth, and remarkable stability in light of the ebb and flow of editors, let it reserve at least one chapter for you.

Thanks also for dealing with Wik and Quagga (I swear, I'm back one day and I stumble into that edit war...I almost screamed and logged out...of all the people I did _not_ want to deal with...) and the Shnorrer piece.  I've tried to get a dialogue going on the article's talk page, because clearly there isn't a consensus about exactly how the article should be left.  Maybe you'll join me there when you have time.

Finally, a long time ago you emailed me an invitation, which I very ungraciously never replied to.  I am very sorry about that.  It came, of course, at the wrong time of year for me, given the twin pressures of work and Wikistress, but it was wrong of me not to at least acknowledge your note, and I hope you will forgive the offense.  If you would like to reopen the invite, please email me and let me know.

Lastly...I'd like to give you a barnstar (I gave UC one because I realized how much I admire and rely on him for the work he does), but I just can't.  Not because you're undeserving (good heavens, no), but because I feel as though it would be a little too much like you receiving an award simply for being a good friend, and I'd rather not tarnish the award that way.  I don't know if I'll always feel this way, but I do right now, and I thought I would let you know because, well, that seemed like the best thing to do.  I don't know what I would do around here if not for your support  I likely wouldn't still be editing, or at least my vacation would be lasting a bit longer.

5440,"""

 Are you quoting somebody there, or is this your own list. I'll try to address the points raised:

 1) """"Hearsay"""" is rumour received from others that one did not personally hear oneself. That does not describe Table Talk, which is essentially a primary, contemporary source of edited notes taken down by scribes. Mein Kampf I believe was also began as a text dictated by Hitler, rather than written by Hitler - is that hearsay too? And what of notes taken by Speer - is that """"hearsay""""? (Interesting you note that Bormann was anti-Catholic. Why then would a """"devout Catholic"""" as you term Hitler, appoint an """"anti-Catholic"""" as his Private Secretary and the defacto Deputy Fuehrer?)

2) Multiple translations - a valid issue to raise, but given that Hitler and his henchman all, strangely enough, conversed in German, we are dependent on translations in all cases - whether it be Mein Kampf, Inside the Third Reich, or Table Talk. The fact that authors like Kershaw, Bullock, Encyclopedia Brittanica and Toland all quote from Table Talk is evidence of its essential bone fides - though if you are aware of alternative translations provided by reliable sources, please do present them (or bracket them as """"also translated as"""").

3) The """"bias"""" of the translators. Can you provide reliable sources for this please.

4) I do not know what you mean by """"the Table Talk thoughts do not occur in other private or public conversations"""". Table Talk contains all sorts of quotes which are reinforced by other sources! To pluck one from the countless options: Speer (whom you view as a reliable source) says that Hitler made """"harsh pronouncements against the churches to his political associates in Berlin"""" and specifically notes that Bormann relished to take down Hitler's harshest comments on the Churches. Goebbels diary (per Kershaw & others) is another source, confirming Hitler's thinking on the Church Struggle. 

5) You say """"Nowhere does Hitler denounce Jesus or his own brand of Christianity"""". This comment seems to suggest that you are indeed willing to accept the validity of at least some of the Table Talk text. Good. So please note: the text says Hitler believed """"it is certain that Jesus was not a Jew"""" and that the Apostle Paul """"falsified"""" Jesus' doctrine. These alone are the words of a heretic, not a """"devout Catholic"""". Agreed? As a sign of good faith, it would help at this point if you renounced the claim that Hitler was a """"devout Catholic"""". Beyond this, the transcripts are thoroughly peppered with denunciations of Christianity.

 6) The anti-Christian pronouncements contained in Table Talk are entirely consistent with the Nazi efforts to promote positive Christianity as a substitute for Christianity. The renunciation of the Bible and Jewish origins of Jesus (which """"positive Christianity"""" entailed) was to give him a """"false birth certificate"""" as Cardinal Michael Faulhaber put it in 1933, and the notion of the myth of blood and soil was, as Pope Pius XI wrote in Mit brennender Sorge in 1937, entirely inconsistent with Catholicism and Christianity more broadly: """"The peak of the revelation as reached in the Gospel of Christ is final and permanent. It knows no retouches by human hand; it admits no substitutes or arbitrary alternatives such as certain leaders pretend to draw from the so-called myth of race and blood"""". Hitler, plainly was not in """"good standing with the Church of Rome"""" in 1937!   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0
5441,"""OK, then please explain why a page about a newspaper called the Antelope Valley Press is more notable than a page about a newspaper called the AV News when BOTH publications cover the same area of Los Angeles County. Why are you allowing them to stay up? As for the pasted and deleted content, after my first attempt to create the page was deleted I thought there might be a format issue so I copied the entire AV Press page as a template and then REPLACED ALL OF THE TEXT ABOUT AV PRESS with the text about AV News and the website link thinking that would resolve the issue. As for my use of """"our"""", that was my outrage and having a page deleted almost as it was posted and I should have worded it better. I do not work for the AV News but I was asked to see about getting the page up by others who think people looking at wiki should be aware there are more media outlets in the area than AV Press. I am not sure what other references you need other than the bloody website. Perhaps you could can the head-up-your-ass attitude and give me an example or two of what the lord god almighty Bwilkins finds acceptable?

SO here's the question: Is wiki about getting information out or playing favorites? How much does AV Press donate for such wonderous exclusivity here? Because I simply do not see any other reasonable explanation why AV News keeps getting deleted.

 Botswanan (2) 

I was trying to find a way of editing the table on the right but couldn't find a way to do it. The use of words such as Botswanese or Botswanan is offensive and inaccurate. Can someone please edit the right table and write 'Motswana' instead of 'Botswanan' for Demonym . Also, our national language is Setswana not Tswana . Maybe someone could make these corrections!—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
Thanks, I've done the first.  

It's unfair to call it 'offensive'. This is just how language works. In English the language is also called Tswana, and it's not 'inaccurate'. We don't call Latin 'Lingua Latina', and French 'Français'. The prefix is an aspect of Tswana grammar, which we are not using. And Tswana has its own word for 'English'. One thing though: how would you distinguish between a Motswana (person from Botswana) and any member of the Tswana ethnic group - one fifth of the people of Botswana are NOT ethnic Batswana (many are Khoisan, white, other Bantu tribes...) and about 2/3 of ethnic Batswana live in South Africa. This justifies a word 'Botswanan', whose meaning is at least obvious to any English speaker, and will continue to be used whether the Batswana it or not. And the Batswana can continue to call English by their name for it. It won't be considered offensive or inaccurate.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.185.138.65   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I can't believe that someone would perpetrate intentional vandalism on a site like this which really espouses the ideals of information sharing, open information exchange, and honor-system based knowledge transfer.

I don't take his vandalism on my work personally, but I do take offense to two things:
1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access).
2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.

Personally, I'm glad that he's been blocked, and I don't care if he gets in trouble at work because of his work's proxy being blocked.

Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.  If you insist then you can sign on the bottom line, if anyone comes to harm from biodiesel of any source and in any application you'll take the responsibility, but I don't think that you would be foolish enough to do that.

As an example: The toxicity of erucic acid (see WP under that title) a component of some canola oils and several others is a contentiou issue. Canola (rapeseed) oil is classed as high, medium and low eruc canola oil and only the low erucic acid canola oil is accepted universally for human consumption.

If you study a textbook on vegetable oils and fats you will find that the composition of an oil can depend on which part of the plant it is coming from.

Another example of the danger of generalisation: Is rhubarb toxic ? Its roots are not, but the leafs are deadly. So if you insist on leaving the statement in, then please say what you mean exactly (which biodiesel, when and how)

c)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone was """"embittered"""" that he left. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. Source please?

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was never financially successful, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. They were dropped by Sire Records that same year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced.

b) the template no longer includes “Qur’an” in the bluelighted display.  Editor may choose to write it or not (or “Sura”, or “verse”, etc.) according to context.
c) thus the “-num” variants are redundant and should not be used.

 ? No. That's your interpretation. I simply removed my contributions to those articles. (Whether said contributions improved those articles or not, is matter of opinion. Apparently your opinion was that my edits were improvement. Gee thanks. But it doesn't have to be everyone's opinion, does it? Not even mind sometimes, since my edit history is filled with self-reverts.) You are wrong about """"can't take it back"""", since any self-revert does just that, and self-reverts are permitted, Mr. Mann jess. Again, it is just a matter of opinion whether my edits were improvements or disimprovements. It isn't an objective thing as you portend to assert. I don't have any """"feud"""" with you, Mann jess.

That may well all be true (isn't Perseus at Tuft's though not Harvard? - not that I really know much about its origins) but what particularly bothered me is that there are no citations for any of this outside of Landow himself and his immediate circle.  I don't mean to be spying around and know nothing about your personal relationship but I clicked on your website and saw in 10 seconds that it says right at the top """"neo victorian computing"""" which sounds like Landow in a nutshell and suggests to me some sort of connection.

Sure Coover and Landow are colleagues at Brown, but you could say the same for hundreds of other people, it doesn't change the fact that Coover is one of the US's better known contemporary novelists and Landow is, well, not.  If you turn to other academic departments at a university like Brown, I imagine you'll find faculty members, departmental chairs, and so on, more influential than Landow in their respective fields but with no little """"who's who"""" wikipedia write-ups to show for it.

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it.

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

5681,"""== Re: Telstra Article ==

Hello. I am new to Wiki but thought I had read the T&Cs; fairly well. I am surprised at the number of citations you are demanding for my edit to the Telstra mobile page. Many of the facts you are seeing citations for are indesputible engineering realities and hence you wont find a seperate statement from someone claiming same (although you may find news paper articles backing some of the claims). The points made about 850 having superior coverage to 2100 cant be disputed and I would ask since that being the case, what sort of citation should I be looking for to back up the statement?

I accept referencing Whirlpool for carrier customer numbers is a bit slack. The only reason I did that was that in that discussion thread was a neatly pulled together list of each carriers end of year reports showing their customer base - which highlighted the point that Telstra is the largest carrier by subscriber base at this time. Considering that it is not appropriate to reference a forum thread, how can I best reference this to Wikipedia's satisfaction?

I also note that you removed the citations that pointed back to Telstra.com. The third party aspect of your requirement there is almost not appropriate when you are refering to direct history or a Telstra product reference on the topic. Specifically, the references to Telstra having the first automated mobile network are hard to find anywhere else but on Telstra's media pages - because quite frankly no other operator is going to want to talk about it, and no other Australian source of any repute exists on the internet that would be bothered backing up such claims that I have been able to find (again I dont like quoting news papers because there is no traceability as to the reliability of their sources in the first place - an encyclopedia based on newspapers is a sure way to enshrine into history some editors' warped viewpoint which may or may not be right, but someone reading something and seeing a reference pointing at a news paper may not recognise as simply being another editors point of view.

Please, can you outline how I can more effectively cite elements of my contribution and to an extent justify your requirements for citations where I have not yet been able to find any suitable meaningful references?
   

Hi. I'm not sure if you have checked out Wikipedia:Reliable sources which also links to many other wiki policies. If there is a few lines in the article which is in a source you can cite it more then once using [cite information here] once then adding  on the other sentences with in the article. 

Whirlpool isn't a reliable source but other if it links to a source you could use that source instead but as long as it's reliable source and a third party source.  

Websites Telstra and any company it owns isn't a third party source which can be seen a bias and can be seen as a point of view which it way we use third party sources (See Self-published sources).

Newspapers can be used whether or not it's a website or you can just reference the title of the article, name of the paper, page, date it was printed and who the story was written by, As you can trace Newspapers who's stories may not be online or the story was before the internet was around. I hope this helps.

Another administrator repeatedly deleted a link I added to a page. I have already added that link to three other pages without difficulty. When I asked him to justify it, the request was ignored. When I reinstated the link, I got banned by him. Arbitrary. I am in the hands of fools in this place.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

 Definition for the list 

In light of the above discussions, and the fact that the list is too inclusive to be useful (or unbiased), I propose that a very narrow definition of terrorism be used for this list. I think Garzón's definition is good for this purpose, and should be applied to territories where the state in question has control. The current list includes a lot of cases that can be (sub)categorized in other ways, such as """"international terrorism"""" (including state-sponsored international terrorism), War Crimes, and Human Rights Violations. Perhaps there could be one list that uses a narrow definition of state terrorism, followed by the more general list. That's just my suggestion, I actually don't have the expertise on this topic get deeply involved in this.  21:13, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

This is nothing  as trivial as  """"Ice Ice Baby"""". If """"Ice Ice Baby"""" caused controversy about attribution of the music (It was only 5 notes and the 4th and 5th were slightly different !) then Candy Man should also attribute music to the authors of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy's music.

Hi AL
I hope you don't think I'm being cheeky but I would appreciate your advice. My wife and I are currently in southern France and will shortly be heading off in our campervan to visit northern Spain, hoping to get to the far north-west. On checking our time schedule, we find that we have a week extra, so are thinking of visiting northern Portugal, although we are unlikely to get further south than Porto. As we have no travel guides to Portugal, can you recommend any places to visit. 
Thanks for any advice.

 Hello 

Hi HaiB, I just wanted to thank you for your concern, and express my appreciation for your proactive approach in recent matters.  At this time I am not actively seeking any escalation to what I consider to be a difficult editor.   If blowing off a little steam on my talk page is what it takes to reduce overall drama on the site, and get back to building and protecting this project - I am more than willing to shoulder these types of things.  While administrators are editors equal in stature to those who are not wielding the couple extra buttons, we are expected to conduct ourselves with a higher degree of integrity, and often come under fire for the actions that we must undertake.  I realized that when I accepted my RFA nom., and am willing to suffer the occasional insults and attacks that our less congenial editors wish to throw.  Thank you again for your concern, your kindness, and your integrity; it is much appreciated. ;) —    ?  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Notability Criteria - Clubs affiliated to Västerbottens Fotbollförbund 

Clubs playing in Division 4 and below may not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.  If you wish to produce a Wikipedia page for your club I suggest that you ensure that you take appropriate measures to emphasise that your club is notable.  This may be achieved by including details of at least one of the following:

1. - club achievements in particular competing in the higher levels of the Swedish football league system (Division 3 and above 1987 onwards / Division 4 and above pre 1987); 
2. - a notable player(s) who has played for the club;
3. - widening the description of the club to include details of other sections of the club (some of whom may have made a notable contribution to their sport);
4. - significant club infrastructure that has been provided or is managed by the club such as an indoor sports hall and all weather pitches;
5. - special contribution to the local community such as clubs serving the needs of ethnic communities;
6. - unique features such as an island location or historic stadium.

Failure to meet notability criteria could result in your page being recommended for deletion.

 Whole Lotta Darwin? 

Just a query. Is the appearance of Charles Darwin in every section of today's Main Page except """"In The News"""" intentional?   
Almost certainly. As you'll have noticed, it's his 200th birthday. Algebraist 
Here is the discussion on the timing of today's featured article. Algebraist 
Shiny. Thanks )   
It's also Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and he gets shafted.    
He's mentioned once in OTD and twice in DYK. If you had a relevant TFA choice, you should've posted it to Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests at the appropriate time (weeks ago). Algebraist 
I stand corrected, but it is still 5:3 in favor of Darwin.  
Is your suggestion to put licoln's name twice randomly on main page to make it even? The way i see it both were given importance and there is no reason for them to appear exactly the same number of times. there were featured items available for Darwin, hence they were used. if u have suggestion to improve current items then please provide them rather than complaining about ratio.   
Insert picture of Wikipe-tan huggling Darwin and lonely Lincoln off in the corner.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.73.70.113   
He needs the love; over at the ever understated and equitable Conservapedia, he appears on the main page in a split-image alongside Adolf Hitler.  
Yeah, I love the way Conservapedia manages to give the impression that racism from the likes of Hitler and (allegedly) Darwin is a bad thing... but as I recall some of the things they said about Obama during last year's campaign... """"understated and equitable,"""" indeed. 168.9.120.8  
Hey - this'll start a bunfight. It could be argued that in the grand scheme of things, Darwin is way more important - his discoveries have a worldwide importance and effect, while ol Abe really only affected the US. 86.155.202.152  
I was going to say the same thing. Darwin is far more significant in the longrun and worldwide.

[Mahajan: 1972: 550 ff.] The conclusion is obvious that they were not considered by the original residentsto be respectable, to start with. This is because """"Raaja"""" means royal but """"Raj"""" means semen. The progeny of mixed marriages is even now called by that name in some parts. The condition of woman was deteriorating. The question of women education was unthinkable. Obscene Art flourished during Rajput age. The originality of the ancient times was lost and the ancient culture degenerated.

I'm fed up with the typical acne faced loser who can't get a date with a woman or a man, and so spends his time in front of his computer screen making alliances with other awkward socially malnourished dweebs who  can think of nothing better than to try an interact only thorugh the computer. You do a disservice to all computer geeks everywhere by trying to be more intelligent than others, because the lack of your vision seeps through the anger you display for all to see. Any true hacker knows that the way you have taking stands here has opened you up for retribution, as I am nnot a hacker, I won't work on such matters, in negative aspects. But you should be mindful that you've made a strong mess here, and no matter what your own opinon is, oyu should learn manners, and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites.

The only thing that needs to be changed is that the numbers of those killed needs to increase significantly. I know there was a lot more than 3,000 people killed. The Government furthermore did indeed organize the massacres. Not to mention the government soldiers were committing massacres against Tamils in Northern Sri Lanka, the same time Tamils were massacred in Southern Sri Lanka around Colombo in 1983, which apparently is the """"capital"""" of the """"entire"""" Sri Lankan Country!? Plus what makes this all nonsense is that there are massacres against Tamils continuing today. The Sri Lankan military (armed by: India, Pakistan, Israel, USA, Great Britain, China, Australia, Russia) has already killed 100s of Tamils in Sambur in a Northern Town of Sri Lanka. I think that its time to admit all truths, because lying and denying won't get us anywhere. This is becoming a cat and mouse game.

This news was taken out 1 year old traced back to the Mercury news. The name of Pakistan and a beauty pageant has made it interesting enough. So far and far, Harry the Dirty Dog  this user is doing vandalism and it seems he is not allowing for us to remove the non-reliable sources and references. 
Also this user seems to have a personal agenda to secure this as far as possible, and seems to me, this user Harry the Dirty Dog  is on a personal agenda of defaming this lady. There is no proof and this is a rumour according to me and is supposed to be dismissed. If any one needs to research then one must google up and find out what she is up to!

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

6170,"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

My proposal is that we rewrite the article to include the latest official numbers, and make sure it is understood why Gibson only managed to play 510 Negro League games in his career.  It will inclu",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site. 

This is just plain sad. I am a susbcriber to Jane's Intelligence online, and I found the article easily. (you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit.

 Re: Last names 

Definitely trivia. Your method of inserting the information was unclear and potentially harmful, ths the revert. Also, if you do add it properly, take care with your wording. Asserting that the name similarity was intentional might constitue original research. I'd got for something like """"many of the many character have surnames similar to scientists.

As for reverting, I tend to do that whenever an edit is clearly not helpful. Leaving a message is usually something I don't do unless the issue is vandalism or persistant.

Dear Lex, Thanks for your clarification of Judge Learned Hand. I guess I should not trust my memory.

The only times I remember citing blogs were the WSJwhen I cited the article, not the commentary, which was an interview. That was deleted.and when I used them as evidence of pro se dissatisfaction.  I see that you also deleted a quote of a court case that was in a blog.  I am positive that that was an accurate quote of a transcript with a statement by a federal judge.  I will have to go read up on Wikipedia sources again.

Also I am positive that the quote about the federal district court discouraging pro ses from using their mediation is correct, but I will have to check on the link.  Why didn't you just flag the source instead of deleting it?

Please don't insult me.  I am not trying to insult you.

Other than my complaints of censorship, please provide three examples of what you claim was my """"disruptive"""" editing.  Or do you just want to go on with the article from where we are?

This is an example of an unsupported statement in the article that I don't believe is true: """"The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if resolution requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. While this rule creates a double standard"""".  I think this means """"pro se litigants get an unfair advantage"""". Wasn't it you that wrote that?
FYI, I was put in jail  for over 4 months solely for engaging in pro se litigation.  The only way I could get out was to agree to withdraw all pro se litigation. My husband was threatened w jail for paying for me to file a complaint while I was in jail and paying for a typist.  And no, I don't believe there is a a history of """"putting people in jail who think the rules don't apply to them and who can't conform themselves to them.""""  To the best of my knowledge, in civilized countries people are only put in jail for committing crimes and as far as summary contempt use of jail is very limited.

 2011 British GP team orders 

Before this turns into an edit conflict, what needs to be considered is that stating 'Vettel finished second after ...team orders...' incorrectly implies that he finished second because of those team orders. Since Webber himself admits that he ignored the team orders and still tried to overtake Vettel, IF it needs to be included, it needs to be reworded:
Although Vettel's KERS was malfunctioning at times, he was able to pass Massa on the track and took back second place. After a strong charge from Mark Webber towards the end, Webber was asked to """"maintain the gap"""" and not try to make a move on Vettel. Although Webber ignored his team's requests and tried to pass Vettel, Vettel was able to hold him off and finish second behind Alonso.http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/grand-prix-2011/frustrated-mark-webber-ignored-team-orders-in-vettel-chase/story-fn7r7gmb-1226092001816""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 blockade of Cadiz 

Dear sir. Thank you for asking me first. 
Naval blockades are just """"blockades"""" and cannot be described as """"battles"""", because they're not. This article refers to the assault on the city by Nelson's amphibious forces. After having failed to bombard the town, Nelson was dispatched on the even more disatrous Santa Cruz expedition, later in the month. The blockade effectively went on, but St. Vincent withdrew the main fleet to the Tagus in the atumn, keeping a squadron of observation cruising off Cadiz during the winter...

The name """"Assault on Cadiz"""" instead """"Blockade of Cadiz"""" gives this engagement a more accurate and specific name, because a maritime blockade is not a sea battle. Another article could be """"the blockade of cadiz!"""", where you could write every feat of arms that occurred from 1797 until 1798-1802, but as the blockade of cadiz is not a """"campaign"""", it has no sense to even think about it.

 More on changes made to """"Early Soviet Rule and World War II section"""" 

I will not respond to the personal attack directed at """"the person who simply reverted this passage..."""". As for the substance of the issue:

1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.

2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 

3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?

The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now. Please, no flames.  19:00, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Instead you write """"I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations."""" Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)?
@ your argument """"The British colonists had made North America their country"""" is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word """"Confederate"""" for """"rebel"""" so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence """"The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests"""".

Hi Peridon,

As requested, please find source below:

African Languages and Ebonics by Dr. Katherine Harris, Central Connecticut State University.  Africa Update. Vol. IV, no. 3 (Summer 1997) Pan-African Language Patterns Revisited:  

""""The erosion of African names also occurred. Samba, meaning comfort in Wolof, is still recalled in musical form in Brazil, where there remains a strong African presence. A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

 Editing of Anthony Hungerford 

Dear Phillip,

               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!
I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.

My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. 
The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.

If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –

•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: """"Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""""
•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.

I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.
I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.

 Bioresonance therapy and Scientology 

Hi there

Casting my mind back to January 2010, as evidenced in the diff. I think I wanted to make more precise a previous editor's mention of """"the E-Meter used by Scientology"""" in the Bioresonance therapy article - and so I found the citation which I added, and which as it stands appears to link Franz Morell (rather than bioresonance therapy itself) with Scientology. That """"factoid"""" might live more comfortably on a Wikipedia entry for Franz Morell, but no such article exists... though the article referenced: http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does provide more detail. (The reference you gave to https://tools.wmflabs.org/cluebot/?page=View&id;=1909882 brings up only a blank page in my browser. If the referenced article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does indeed have methodological deficiencies, we can change our article to state that """"Franz Morell allegedly had links with Scientology'...)

A very rough translation of the cited article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf - based loosely on the translation provided in Google Chrome, looks something like this:

Scientology and Bioresonance Therapy

Bioresonance Therapy includes the """"alternative"""" treatment of diseases such as allergies, eczema and asthma and in  """"alternative"""" dental treatment an ever broader space. 
Bioresonance therapy goes back to  an alleged discovery of the in the Year 1990 deceased Frankfurt Doctor and senior Scientologist Dr. Franz Morell. 
Dr. Morell had in the 70s of the 20th century the allegedly """"genius idea"""" of eliminating patients' harmful mood-swings by reflecting them .

[Footnote 1:  Dr. Eva Rasche in a """"MORA Patient information"""" document published by the F. Dermatological  health center Wadern Elvi Foss -  http://www.degezet.de/leistung.htm
] 

Together with his Stepson Erich Rasche, Morell developed in the year 1977 the so-called MORA-therapy and MORA gear necessary for the therapy. 
In just this period of time Dr. Franz Morell was a Scientology activist. 
So founded Dr. Franz Morell on the 12th June 1970 together with six other like-minded people in Frankfurt the Club """"College for Applied Philosophy e.V."""". 
According to the at-the-time built Statute, the Club should exclusively serve """"scientific and research-supporting ends"""" and organize 'Courses for the enhancement of consciousness by practical application of the philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, known under the name Scientology"""". 
Appart from that,  Dr. Franz Morell co-operated in the year 1975 on the foundation of the Scientology Tranorganisation """"Narconon"""" in Frankfurt. 
Likewise in the Year 1975 was Dr. Franz Morell in the by the Stuttgart Scientology branch issued Magazine College No. 11 referred to as """"for years highly trained Scientologist"""". 
Dr. Franz Morell was, when he made public his method of treatment, since many years an active Scientologist, who openly held L. Ron Hubbard teaching and techniques as an appropriate basis for scientific and educational activity. 
Under the given conditions it appears not surprising that the idea of bioresonance therapy shows parallels to Scientology practices including: While supporters of  Bioresonance therapy believe appropriate equipment can catch harmful moodswings of people and by the generation of corresponding counter-vibrations can weaken or delete them, Scientologists see in so-called engrams a type of spiritual disruption fields, which with Scientology auditing with the help of the bioresonance devices - quite similar to the so-called E-Meter (electric meter) - can be tracked and deleted. 
The MORA-Gerät is still distributed by the Company Med-Tronic Trading Ltd. 
in  Friesenheim. 
Erich Rasche is Managing Director of the Company Med-Tronic. 
In view of the social and family Relations between Dr. Morell and Mr. Rasche one can hardly assume that the activities of the late Franz Morell for Scientology remained hidden to Mr. Rasche.  
The Term """"Bioresonanztherapie"""" was according to the Company Regumed Regulatory Medizintechnik GmbH in Gräfelfing coined by its own executive director Hans Brügemann. The firm Regumed Ltd. markets a therapeutic device comparable to the MORA-gear, called the BICOM-Gerät, which in the words of Hans Brügemann originated """"in collaboration with Dr. Morell"""".

 My Draft of Kaithal honour killing case 

The Kaithal honour killing case is an honour killing of newly-married Manoj Banwala and Babli in June 2007 after a ‘khap panchayat' (caste-based council among Jats) in their Karora village in Kaithal district, Haryana, passed a decree prohibiting marriage against societal norms. Both belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community. Hence, they were declared brother and sister, though not directly related, and their marriage was declared invalid and incestuous. When the couple refused to abide by the ruling and got married, they were abducted and killed by the bride's relatives.

After the verdict of the Khap panchayat, the state government raised no concern. According to Home Minister P. Chidambaram, the UPA-led central government is to propose an amendment to the Indian Penal Code to outlaw honour killings.

In March 2010, a Karnal district court ordered the execution of the five perpetrators in this case, the first time a court in Haryana has ordered justice be served in an honour killing case. The court gave life sentence to the khap head who ordered the killings but did not participate, while the driver in the kidnapping was sentenced to seven years.

Murder
 on April 2007.]]
On April 6, 2007, Manoj Banawal, the owner of an electronics repair shop at Kaithal, eloped with Babli, a resident of the same village, to Chandigarh and applied for a registered marriage on May 31, 2007. They secretly married and started living in Karnal. Unhappy with the marriage, Babli's family asked the local khap panchayat to intervene, which dissolved the marriage. Families in Manoj's village were ordered not to talk to the couple. Manoj moved with Babli to another village and asked the police for help, which accompanied them to a Kaithal court on June 15, 2007. The judge ordered police protection for the two.

After the trial, Manoj and Babli, accompanied by police assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away.{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/op-ed/feudal-justice-feudal-crime-034|title=Feudal justice for a feudal crime|last=Sen |first=Antara Dev|date=3 April 2010|",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

(This is the most quoted of Zafarnamah.300 years ago, Guru Gobind singh ji had laid down the circumstances when a person or a nation can pick up the sword against the other)
23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).

 Let's Clarify Something here 

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

 Hello Queen Cake!  Your comments to me about the """"veracity"""" and the """"worthiness"""" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?

User#24.168.66.27, Please don't delete my posts.  That is very rude.

The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:

If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.
    
It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.  
 
It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.

For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I'll go ahead and do the page move.  I'll probably wait till tomorrow my Internet time is drawing to a close, and since I haven't done hatnotes very often, I'll want some time to read up on them and correct any mistakes that I make.

Regarding references, I don't think you need to include a citation after every sentence, as long as they're not direct or indirect quotes, and/or potentially controversial in any way.  This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph.  If I use multiple sources in a paragraph, but I don't quote anybody or include anything that might come into dispute, I usually stick a string of citations at the end of the paragraph.  To me, that makes the text a little more readable.

Also regarding citations, you can save yourself a few keystrokes on repeated citations where you're using a name.  Once you've created a citation with a name, you don't have to type """"""""; you can just use """""""", with the slash at the end of the tag.  That'll give you a tiny bit less keyboarding to do, and it also makes it a little easier to edit when there's a string of citations less risk of losing the closing """""""" tag.  I've done this with the Lt. Cherry article, if you'd like to check it out.

If you want to get a little fancier, I like to use list-defined references, which is what I did with Lt. Cherry's article.  Basically, that involves putting the citation information inside the {{Reflist}} in the references section.  That way, it doesn't get eliminated by accident if somebody edits out a passage including citation information and doesn't check the edit summary to make sure that they're not orphaning a """""""" tag.  It's also easier to read the text in the edit window if you don't have to wade through tangles of citation details.

By the """"Ft. Table"""", did you mean the boxed business in the upper right?  In Wikiparlance, that's known as an infobox, and you put them in using templates.  The one you'd probably want to use for Ft. Niobrara is Template:Infobox military installation.  If you'll follow that Wikilink, you can see how it works.  You don't have to fill in all the parameters on an infobox if some of them aren't applicable or if you don't have the information, you can leave them blank.

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that """"static if"""" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too.

 Phases of migraine terminology 

Migraine (history page) 
2006-10-08T13:23:04 Msteri (Talk | contribs) m (?Aura phase - This was NOT a typo. """"Headache phase"""" is appropriate AND from the source cited. Please do not change this again.) 

From User talk:Milomedes 
When I typed """"headache phase,"""" that's exactly what I meant. It was not a typo. Headache phase is as correct as pain phase, and headache phase is the terminology used in the source that I very carefully cited. Why did you feel it necessary to make this change? It makes no sense to me to take up people's time in this fashion. 
Thank you, 
 

This is a community issue so I'm moving it to the talk page. Milo  

First, I didn't think it was a typo. Both """"headache phase"""" and """"pain phase"""" terms are (or were) in use, though I don't know which is used more commonly. I do know that """"pain phase"""" is a better term for three reasons: 1) abdominal migraine isn't in the head, 2) the """"headache"""" word is recursively overused, 3) """"-ache"""" underdescribes the sensation, and, 4) """"pain"""" is shorter. You can argue with 2), 3),4), but 1) is technically a debate stopper.
Second, with all due respect to your professional writing expertise, just because you carefully copied the words that were used in your source, doesn't mean that I can't substitute different words that I have reason to think are better. I quote from concluding text at the bottom of every edit page: 
""""Please note: If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. """"
Third, Wikipedia isn't about you or me. I didn't know you wrote it, and it shouldn't matter that you did. This is an interactive community process. If you think I'm taking up your time, then you probably don't have enough time to write here. Furthermore, if you assume that anything you write here is still going to be here, say, 10 years from now, then you probably don't understand the nature of Wikipedia. 
As to disagreements about which terminology to use in the article, that is usually handled with a talk page poll. I respectfully suggest that we use that tool as needed.  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

DO you know what the word PLOT means?
  TAB
 TAB
Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie.

Read what's in the Plot section of """"solaris"""" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations.

Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page:
  TAB
 TAB
""""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them.""""

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0

Quantrill's Raiders

Thank you for your copy edits and reference work on the article Quantrill's Raiders. You have, by your edits, cleaned up most if not all of the NPOV issues I had with the article. I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it. Anyway, thanks for your edits and when you feel that the article has been edited enough to warrant removal of the tag, you certainly have my blessing. Cuprum17 (talk)

On that website that was used as a source is a Article on Melungeons which states """"Conclusions
Solid genealogical study of Melungeon ancestry overwhelmingly leads to a simple conclusion. The primary genetic makeup of Melungeons - that which gives them their Melungeon physical characteristics - comes from certain Native American tribal genetic lines. Careful genealogical research, working backward from universally accepted Melungeons, shows their ancestral lines go back to Native Americans. The truth may not be as exciting as having an unsolved conundrum but the truth is that Melungeons almost certainly are descendants of the intermarriage of Native Americans with old-world colonists. This isn't an opinion. This is a scientific conclusion. They aren't Portuguese. They aren't Turks. They are Native Americans.""""  The Melungeon Mystery Solved by James S. Elder

@Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are

 Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.  
 Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly)
 Theoretical model: Feedback

As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. 

The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article. 

The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.

The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Again, I began by saying that I don't think the word is perfect and that it needed to be worked out here rather than simply excised with an NPOV comment on the edit. And, actually, I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg's mouth later in the article, but I don't believe that this entirely addresses POV/NPOV. My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal""""). In any case, to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article, and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort.

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

Why not have it as a seperate article on terminology? Because Terminology of the British Isles already exits. Why not redirect to the terminology page? Because the title is an another name for the topic described at British Isles not the one described at Terminology of the British Isles.
Why are you so resistant to it being so when it is supported by secondary sources?

Destruction of plants contributes to a lot of the global warmimg. Burning trees releases CO2. Flooding them produces methane. Cutting them down reduces oxygen. Warming the ocean creates methane. Increasng humans, livestock, and garbage/waste add CO2+CH4. There are many indirect ways how people cause global warming. Also, the image seems to show that some areas have cooled slightly. For example, The peninsula of Antarctica near South America has warmed several degrees, while the ice shelf just east of it cooled a few. Is there a reason for this, and will it continue to cool?

Hey.  I see what you mean about a copy violation.  I decided to do some digging and here is something i noticed about the article you pointed out and a change a made during the last peer review. /index.php?title=Phishing&diff;=15483821&oldid;=15478316.  If you look at the compared version of in the link i just provided and the link you gave, you'll see that the paragraph's match after i made a copy edit.  Not previously to that.  If the older version matched the link you provided I would have said otherwise. But after i made a few random changes from what the text originally was, the newer text matches that of what was supposedly copied, I am inclined to say that whoever created the article in the link you provided copied off of wikipedia.  I have seen this happen before with other articles.  May you look into finding a date when the article you gave was created/copyrighted, because I have a feeling that it was created after this article was written.

 Response to Earlier Morality Accusation 
This is inresponse to a cowardly """"unsigned"""" who suggested that Thomas Alva was a pedophile. The entire section was deleted. I think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in Edison's life.
""""Isn't the U.S. age of consent 18?""""-(as """"unsigned"""" stated).  Hey IDIOT, this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw """"young love"""" as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century America. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters """"married off"""" as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get """"radical"""" ideas of """"independence"""" floating in their heads.) Not like the """"mail-order brides"""" of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female ESPECIALLY is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. """"Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?"""" You should also study more about Edison's life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that Edison's second marriage was more a """"politcal"""" arrangement than anything else, as little Mina was a neice of Thomas Alva's principal enemy and competitor JUPITER PIERPONT MORGAN. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic """"investment"""" on Morgan's part to overtake Edison' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that Morgan a a ROBBER BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call Alva Edison a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) Veryverser

Following this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his """"genelogical study"""" of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that Edison lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with... 

We are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. """"women's liberation"""", all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in North America by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's """"middle-class"""" strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as """"respectable"""" society"""". This all seemed to chagge in America after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite """"cultural shift"""", throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. Edison's age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of Asia and Europe today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the States, various wealthly and powerful men, among them old Hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-brides(Woody Allen, Rupert Murdock as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, ORIENTAL WOMEN, rather than western ones for their """"sunset years""""). In Alva Edison's case, this was sort of a """"wirlwind romance"""" manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at Edison and control of his company. Think Napolean Bonafart's divorce of Josephine to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a """"political"""" union.

 Myself and the Sante Kimes Wikipedia article 

I would like to set some things straight about myself and the Sante Kimes article.

1. I am NOT Sante Kimes.

2. I am NOT a relative of Sante Kimes.
3. I DO NOT HAVE or EVER HAD an attorney contacting Wikipedia. This is on outrageous claim.

I AM a researcher of well-known court cases, and have researched the Sante Kimes case in the past.

SUBJECT BAN
 1. Since an administrator asked me to voluntarily not edit anything on the Sante Kimes article, I have complied.

2. If those interesting in my edits to the Sante Kimes article, please just see the article's edit history.
Since making editing mistakes on my FIRST-EVER edits on Wikipedia, I have complied with the appropriate editing guidelines.
Namely,
Posting in the discussion page of the article about ANY large edits I felt appropriate for the article.
 Placing details and reason for the edit in editing tags.

Please see the article's editing history to see that the only edits I have made were to correct dates, spelling mistakes, adding verifying tags, and making small corrections to the article that were needed. Furthermore I gave full details for the changes I made in the editing notes Please see the article's editing history to confirm this.

3. The only edit that I made that was in debate was the article's 'lead' info.
I do contend that the current 'lead' starting with """"American felon"""" was placed there as an action of spite by that editor.

The 'lead' I placed WAS of a neutral POV, factual WITH EXACT dates for the named convictions and was supported by references. 
The current 'lead' does not state the dates for when these conviction took place. 
Furthermore, I had placed """"American woman"""" in the 'lead', which IS in the 'lead' of various other female criminal's articles who (arguable) allegedly committed WORSE crimes than Sante Kimes is accused of committing.
If it's appropriate for those articles, why is it not appropriate for this article?

In closing, I DID follow editing guidelines for the Sante Kimes article after I learned what was acceptable editing.
Furthermore, I discussed - at length - in the article's discussion page about changes that I felt WERE needed. Yet I NEVER took it upon myself to edit those issues until an agreement could be reached. 

I would like to point out that those changes have yet been agreed upon and I HAVE NOT made any edit in regard to those issues. Therefore, that demonstrates that I am following the editing guidelines.

Because of an apparent personal problem an administrator has with me. - Which is the same editor I was in dispute with on this article's discussion page They have asked me to voluntarily not edit the article - or, most outrageously, not EVEN post on the article's discussion page to discuss the issues with this article.(How is this not considered conflict of interest??)  
I have complied with that request, even though I have not yet read or been advised as to what guideline I was in violation of in regard to the Sante Kimes article or it's discussion page.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I have nothing against the members and I am sure that the aims and goals of the project and the people involved with it are only trying to help Wikipedia. However, I find the idea of having to ask permission to edit is un-Wikipedia like. We trust editors to create articles, complex templates, categories and upload material, but to create a stub type, they have to ask permission. Do you not find it a bit strange that you need to ask permission (Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion/Log/2008/April/6) to delete a category, update nine templates and create the correct category?

I generally agree with Dr. Blofeld here.  My own view, which I think I may have never expressed out loud before, is that it is no longer wise or useful to restrict DYK links on the front page to new articles.  At one time, this may have been a good way to incentivize people to write new articles on interesting topics, now it may be leading to unnecessary recentism as well as limiting the scope of what ought to be one of our most amazing and charming front page features.  People, including me, love """"did you know"""" tidbits that are interesting and surprising - so why should we restrict ourselves to selecting just from new articles?  (And since I haven't commented yet, although my views are well known, I think using the Daily Mail as a source for fluff is a really bad idea, always.

...

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

Page shall contain the exact definition of what a processor is, microsoftly speaking. Indeed, this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites.

For instance, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsserver/evaluate/features/compare.mspx, we can find:
Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 (64 bits):
- 4-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support

Other example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/x64/standard.mspx
- memory-bound applications that do not require more than four processors.
- supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1- to 4-way servers.
- Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server)

If we refer to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture. Thus, by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support, sometimes about 4-way SMP support, Microsoft confuses us all.
Coming to a Quadri 4-cores based server (16 SMP), this leads to go from a Standard edition (4 processors support) to a DataCenter edition (4x4=16 SMP support), thus raising the license price as for no less than +700%.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Atlanterhavsveien
Sorry I forgot to log in when editing that page. I'd stick with both points of my edits though - Wikipedia definitely doesn't use """","""" as the decimal separator, even on Continental European articles, or when working in kilometres. Secondly, it's a road, not a bridge. However, it is a road that has a lot of bridges on it - a good analogy is the Overseas Highway in the Florida Keys. For now I'd be happy to leave it in the bridge section. I don't understand why you reverted the inclusion of Category:Roads in Norway - I mean, it is a road, and it's in Norway, right?  
No worries, apology appreciated ) It looks like you do a lot of good work here, thanks!

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

 I'm a little confused with the first statement you make. """"A gas is 'ideal' at sufficiently low pressure, p."""" I'm not arguing it but I feel like theres two ideas in there that are a little confusing... a gas can act any which way it wants to at any given ambient conditions, whether under those conditions it follows the model stated by the """"Ideal Gas"""" is a totally different thing. If we consider a """"gas"""" as one model and an """"Ideal Gas"""" as another then we can see where the two correlate (under what conditions they correlate). Whether they correlate more at """"sufficiently low pressure"""" is fine but thats not what I'm trying to explain in the article. The model for an """"Ideal Gas"""" has is own conditions and assumptions, thats the only thing I'm trying to display in the method of writing this article. Most people confuse the concept of an Ideal Gas and other simplifications of gases with the actual gas itself. Basically, I'm trying to have people say """"This gas behaves as an Ideal Gas under these conditions"""" instead of """"This gas is an Ideal Gas"""". I don't have any issue with your equations, I don't understand where that brings any more clarity to the statement.   

 Also, deviations from the """"Ideal Gas model"""" is not necessarily just phase-changes or chemical reactions. I can theoretically squeeze enough gas into a container to where intermolecular forces would become significant enough to where the gas deviates from the ideal model.

The war criminals cat is generally a difficult one to consider NPOV is many situations. In this particular case though, the Drljevic article makes no mention of any war crimes, except that the Partisans considered him a criminal. I'm afraid the Partisans are not the most neutral source on the matter. I have no idea personally, whether he committed crimes, but the cat is POV until there's at least some mention of them.

 I'm sorry but you are factually WRONG.  As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both """"add-on"""" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.

You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the guide to appealing blocks first. Bbb23 (talk) 
I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

You are an atrocious liar, Bob Rayner.

Because that is in fact what it is. It is not controversial at all. By contrast, your arbitrary vandalism of other's texts has nothing to do with accuracy and neutrality, but with your own perceptions, biases and prejudices what is acceptable or preferable. You are fighting your own propaganda war in wikipedia, as shown exactly by what you deleted and added across time. That's bad, but what makes it worse is two things: the evidence is that you frequently have no real experience or competency with regard to the subjectmatter, and you provide no satisfactory explanations or discussions for cutting out very large parts of texts from articles written by others.

Hi, Quaranj
Just curious why you think material in Wikipedia is """"leading to death threats and other hate-crime related events""""? The material is widely proliferated - a quick Google search turns up hundreds of pages, including references in SPIN, CMJ, and Vibe magazines.  Having the material here would seem to be minor compared to those nationally published magazines.
Furthermore, if Jordana wishes to have the material removed, there is a process she can follow to have that done. If you are not she, then you are going against consensus by removing the properly sourced material.

 Edits with a seemingly personal agenda 

Dear Sir:

Recently you have made misleading edits that constitute vandalism on the """"Barlas"""" page on Wikipedia. To the ethnicity of the Barlas as being Turko-Mongol you added """"Persianized"""" - this is a general and ambiguous term and there is no way to verify such an assertion - you then footnoted it with a book on the Persians but never really provided the exact quote you are relying upon - first, I would ask you do that, and second, even if you can provide the exact quote from the book on the Persians, I suggest you examine the validity of such an assertion. 

Barlas is a world wide clan that was originally Mongol and then was Turkicized through intermarriage with Turks - Iran was one of many countries ruled by this clan and to use this simple fact to assert they were """"Persianized"""" seems inappropriate and misleading and an attempt at trying to reduce the authenticity of the facts on this page.

Also, how can you change """"Central Asia"""" to """"Greater Persia"""" when Central Asia is what exists in fact and """"Greater Persia"""" is just a concept or a term of reference and does not exist in fact?

I have seen your previous edits and it seems your efforts to change the ethnicity and culture of the Barlas clan are aimed at a personal agenda to contend, perhaps due to your religious inclinations, as has been unsuccessfully tried before, that the Barlas were associated with Persia. Sir, your words cannot change the truth and I would ask you refrain from playing with such things for personal motives. If you persist with trying to dilute the quality of this article with misleading assertions, I will notify Wikipedia and ask them to ban you.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

I have not really been around for weeks, indeed months, but I have been suffering regular harassment from Jbhunley, and you and others seem to be condoning his behaviour. It is never acceptable for someone to give another person unwanted attention for months on end.

 Many of the articles he nominates for deletion should be tagged, not deleted. Wikipedia needs improvement, not amputation.

 He does not seem to read or research the articles he nominates properly.

I strongly advise you to stop spamming Wikipedia articles with your third-rate publications. This is an encyclopaedia, not a platform for the promotion of misleading self-published copies of official reports masquerading as books, and abusing our facilities in this way is liable to result in you being blocked from editing. While there is clearly little we can do to stop you promoting your ripoffs elsewhere, we are certainly under no obligation to permit you to do so here. AndyTheGrump (talk) 

is pure slander. You accuse an acclaimed writer (just check amazon.com or Barnes&Noble;) of writing """"ripoffs"""", publishing third rate publications and """"masquerading"""" etc. I can sue you for that. I did explain exactly why we publish these books but you seem to lack the level of understanding it. You hide behind childish names such as """"Andy Grump"""", """"Streetwalker"""" or """"I love horses"""". What is that a children's playground? I demand within 24 hours  an apology and putting back on the appropriate websites the additions I made.

 One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as """"Piper""""' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.

A former legal secretary, air force welder and mechanic and apparent high school graduate; she manages to alienate almost everyone and thing she touches.  She created a five month row that went all the way to end because she didn't like the fact that others disagreed with her (soundly outvoted her) on how to name diambiguate some TV series.

She went into a WW III mode with Dreamguy over similar inconsequential matters.  She counts among her followers other mindless refugees from the ascii gaming community of the 1980's.

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 9000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

What you wrote in this edit blindsided me so completely that it was hard to understand where you were coming from and so to write an efficiently worded reply.  It's not easy for me to grasp that there could be such a point of view as the one you seem to express.  But having pondered it for some time since you wrote this, I think I can attempt a clear, short, and direct reply.  You wrote:
 
 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.
 ...and the method by which it is done, in addition to being so short and simple, is elegant, immediately startling, and potentially enlightening in that you immediately wonder if it fits into some larger pattern that would give you insights not otherwise available.
 
You almost seem to treat the fact that π is approximately 3.1416 as if it were self-evident, rather than something that can be seen only at considerable expense.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

The categorization is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, members of the Church are often known as """"Mormons,"""" but that is the nickname that a lot of people call them by. The Church says that the official term for these members is """"members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.""""

Of course some people think that's rather long to say, so the church acknowledges that people will often call the members just """"Mormons."""" Nevertheless, that remains as only a nickname for the church and part of the official name of one of the books of scripture, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, because of the prophet named Mormon who abridged the original writings. The only other official names with """"Mormon"""" in them are the book Mormon Doctrine and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. As for members themselves, reference to them as """"Mormons"""" remains only a nickname.

So you say that the official info box text is to leave it without nickname quotes. So what? Why shouldn't we ammend that official policy so that it makes room for that type of labeling? And so what if there is """"no need"""" (<- those are the """"you're saying it, not me; and not that I believe you"""" quotes right there) to change it? That doesn't mean there would be anything """"wrong"""" (as you'd probably say) with adding them, does it? They are not errant. They are not like adding an apostrophe to a word where none belongs, in an attempt to form a plural! They are good to show outsiders the difference between the official church name and the nickname.

7740,"Tangential Forces 
 
The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.

During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.

We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.

In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.

In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.

Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.

More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

My name is Julio Cespedes, I do not know if I went to the right place, but to be quite honest the vandalism process on Wikipedia is pretty daunting to the casual novice. I am from Mississippi and went to Madison Central High School there, which has recently been the subject of a lot of vandalism:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Central_High_School_%28Mississippi%29

It is actually one of the best high schools in the State and very competitive nationallyin the city of Madison, MS all factors for why it may have been the subject of vandalism.

Wow, what cat and mouse games you are playing. My first sentence is fact. I might have used sarcasm in my reply to you, but that definitely doesn't compare to the incivility you have committed against me and whoever the other person was who got banned (I'm sorry, don't know who that is, just saw the aftermath).

You were asked about your mistake and a request was made by someone politely before me. Another request was made (again, no clue who it was) providing multiple pieces of evidence. All of this was dismissed, and one of the accounts was blocked as a sock puppet. Me being an organizer of the RHoK event heard there was something up with the Wikipedia page. I go and check, see it's """"Blatant Hoax"""". Of course I am offended, on my back (as well as many others) was this event created and ran and who are you to dispute the facts we presented. My last sentences weren't an attack, it was sarcasm towards the fact I would expect so much better of an admin with your credentials. """"Rogue Admin"""" means you take a critical eye towards """"hoax"""" among other things. So where was the critical eye here? Where was the actions in line with your status at all? From my point of view, here is the course of action:

 1) PMDrive1061 innocently deletes something he thought was a """"hoax"""" without actually looking into it.

 2) Several people come to his talk page and offer facts. The page is then recreated and quickly PMDrive1061 deletes the page and bans one of the users. No discussion, just totalitarian action.

 3) I come along see the aftermath that happens and get validly annoyed and angry. I state a long list of reliable irrefutable sources and make a sarcastic comment about the situation which was more than warranted.

 4) Now this admin is so pushed over the edge, he looses focus of the policies and rules he's here to defend and instead lashes out in every direction banning people at will

 5) Another editor comes in and helps diffuse the situation, who works with me to get the original sources provided into a restored story. I'm told the page is live and that blocks were removed.

 6) I then go to try to edit the page to add one more link and find I am still blocked. I come here, explain my case, then find I am yet again harassed by an admin who seriously doesn't grasp  that he's dived off the deepend and at this point should be asked to stop moderating and push away from the PC as he's lost focus of the real objectives.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand.

 You removed a ref that was to the official site and where it was available online are replaced it with a book.

I haven't clue why you did this as there was no reason.   I just fixed Angel (Madonna song).    
 First of all, try to understand why it was done. Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not? Guess not. Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards.

7961,"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0

I did not set that the proportion justifies any killing. I am just interested in accentuate that for the whole WW II and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is Nazi Germany. There was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion. Also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. To clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited. Many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge. When you take for consideration that every one of fifth Polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether. Now I hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs. Uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those. Feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations.

With accusation you must be very specific. I understand and accepted the consideration about what happen, but be specific. Be very specific, and do not forget that """"first thing must be put first"""". The story is regarding nations rather then individuals. In this case you judge Polish people etc. versus German people. One can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity. However imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation. He was attacked, bitten almost killed. He lost his eye and arm. And now his neighbor says: the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal.

The guy says, but I was attacked and I lost his arm and my eye. Never mine the neighbor says: this is a crime to hit somebody. _  I know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals, but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject """"B"""" arrogantly forgetting about the subject """"A"""".

Nah, to be honest I have dealt with guys like him before and in real life. He works on the basis that he thinks he can frighten folk off his territory by making threats, scaring us with admins, throwing as ***t as they can as they know some will stick - or as you say, the stink of it will frighten others away. 

I looked at the wiki mediation but it is all a waste of energy against anyone that is willing to spend the hours he has done putting together an entirely erroneous and dishonest RfC against Canaen.

But I think I will write to the foundation and find out who their legal counsel because what he has written against Canaen is pure indelible libel. Whereas mediation is a waste of time, the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details. They have to be law.

I approached both of them, him and Skinwaker very reasonably in the first place and straight off received the same modus operandi. he is what he shows himself to be. BTW, I have absolutely no connection with Canaen or anyone else but I recognise decency and indeceny when I see it.

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0

I recommend that you drop this. You have been asked somewhat nicely twice by Admins to either take it to WP:SSP if you had any further suspicions. Now I am giving you pretty much a final warning. Accusing a new editor of being a sockpuppet breaks WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. There is methods to deal with sockpuppetry on WP. Use them. I also notice several comments aimed at trolling other users and soapboaxing. You are on the edge. Take care not to step over.  
1. I have not made and am not making any accusations of sockpuppetry. (Please don't confuse Domer48's wrongful and hysterical misunderstanding of my actual words with what I actually wrote.) Allegations of Sockpuppetry are WP's equivalent of a Witch hunt - and I refuse to participate in such silly nonsense.
My understanding is that neither Tyrenius nor yourself are acting as admins here unless you specifically state that you are so acting. If that is the case I will, of course, follow your advice - even though it seems perverse.
2. Had you not addressed specific remarks to me, I would have stayed silent - as you both should have done.
3. This is what I have already stated: """"I think it would be very helpful at this early stage for User:Brixton Busters to confirm or deny that he previously edited WP using different user names"""" (to his current """"new"""" user name of Brixton Busters) """" - it's entirely a matter for him whether he chooses to reveal those identities or not....""""

Here's a clip from Sedlar's film which shows first issue of the magazine titled """"Ustaša"""" which Pavelić began publishing in the spring of 1930 (skip to 3:13). Although stylized, the header clearly shows an asymmetrical """"U"""" with a bomb in it (symbolizing revolutionary struggle).
At 3:37 in the same clip a magazine cut out showing the UHRO organization logo is shown as printed by them - an asymmetrical """"U"""", a flaming bomb inside it and a chequoy on the bomb. It looks just like the one Nanin7 had made and DIREKTOR removed (bar the dark-blue color which Nanin7 used to fill in the letter U). The original is black-and-white but the letter itself clearly wasn't meant to be black.
At 5:03 in the same clip the front page of the organization's statute is shown, again, with the same logo as described above, dated 1932.
At 5:22 the narrator talks about the organization logo directly and says that """"The """"Ustaša"""" was defined as a revolutionary fighter, also indicated by their logo, which first appeared in the masthead of the magazine """"Ustaša"""" in 1930. Inside a blue letter """"U"""" a silver hand grenade is depicted, with red flames coming out of it. In the centre of the bomb a small Croatian coat of arms is shown, with the top left field in silver."""" As he is saying that yet another picture of the logo is being shown (this one seems to be an enamel badge). The text btw was written by one Mario Jareb, a historian who wrote several books on the history of the Ustaše as well as one on the history of Croatian national symbols.
At 5:55 in the same clip front page of yet another party newspaper titled """"Nezavisna država Hrvatska"""" (published in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco), with the same logo shown, this time in the form of an initial in the main headline, dated 1 May 1934. 
So I don't know how much more official can it get. As for the """"several variant"""" thing - I can only assume they dropped the bomb once NDH was established (since per their logic, the revolutionary struggle has achieved its goal) and replaced it with just a chequoy which was then used as a state symbol later on. I've never seen a cross in combination in contemporary use, only in modern far-right graffiti, but I may be wrong. Either way, this article is about the Ustaše party/movement and this version is the closest we will ever come to what was their official symbol. Only the shade of the color blue can be considered debatable (I tend to think it was probably lighter blue than what Nanin7 used).  (''talk) """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people.

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes. Tags only alert editors to a potential problem, but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it.   """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Error in reasoning. Post-Hardcore is perhaps another variant of Hardcore punk, because it cames from Hardcore punk. But if Lacuna Coil was a Gothic METAL band, they cannot be a Post-Gothic ROCK band, because they never played Gothic ROCK. Thus they're a Post-Gothic-METAL band. That's a big stylistical difference.

 Dogs 

One question, how many dogs do you need to make a """"pack"""" ... three, four, five ... a dozen? Do they not live in three and fours too?

So, should it be, """"They may live in packs, fives, fours, threes, pairs, or singly""""?

The point I am making is this, you made a canonical statement in your summary, """"no evidence ... etc"""" but you did not provide any evidence or reference to sustain it in your edit. 

Can you do so?

The reason I am writing this is because I spent some time cleaning up and developing the Indian pariah dog topic, which I am sure you know. It's obviously a topic which you have some interest and passion in, perhaps even want to promote, which is a good thing. 

But isn't content on the Wikipedia supposed to be supported by references? You may well be right, but you know that's not enough.

I am actually interested in these kinds of dogs and would like to know more but there does not seem to be many academic or other reliable reference to support them. At least in the English language. A lack of dogs overseas means that there seems to be a lack of knowledge and acceptance of their heritage. I know a little more about Spitz types, Shibas etc, which are a little better studied.

A lot of dog and cat topics on the Wikipedia seem to be in bad shape. I'm thinking because they are written by their fans modelled on breeder pages, e.g. every breed appears to """"very intelligent"""". I've yet to read one topic that says the breeds are """"stupid and neurotic"""", and I've met a lot of stupid and neurotic dogs ... even if that's just the owners'/breeders' fault!

Too much work for me to consider taking on right now but at least the Indian pariah dog article is, I think, a little cleaner and in better shape now.

BTW, what are the Hindi/Indian language names for it? Pariah appears to be a Post-British thing. Is it just """"dog""""?

→ see also: Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Little Nobody (2nd nomination)

""""nina phunsta"""" is associated with IF Records so there is a clear conflict of interest. 

A Google search for nina phunsta adequately demonstrates the above claim when reading through various posts on forums. 
Various forum profiles of nina phunsta contain the IF Records website in their signature. This is in contrast to previous claims that Andrez Bergen is a former writing colleague on nina phunsta's talk page . 

""""DSK 1984"""" is harder to pinpoint as it is a relatively newer handle but a Google search presents forum posts mostly related to IF records. 

As for the Little Nobody page:
 ^ Wayward Seafarers Review, Chris Downton. 3D World, June 2008.
This review does not exist on the 3D World website, the link is to the homepage of that website. There are no other external links under references that can be used to verify any of the text on the Wikipedia page. Some of the articles cited are recent so a link to the article on the web version of the newspapers should be provided. The ABC artist profile is the only reliable source and is dated, from 2003 and refers only to a local dance music scene. Many of the links under External Links are broken. 

Much of the information appears to be fabricated as it does not appear anywhere else when performing a Google search. 
Colloquial language in background information: """"Website TABLittle Nobody's dodgy MySpace site"""". This indicates that the article is largely a puff piece. 

Thus, articles related to Little Nobody and IF Records should be removed for:
1. not meeting notability guidelines; and
2. being written in an advertising format
3. large amounts of unverifiable information
  

 (1) No admin has denied the speedy yet but (although it was tagged 12 or more hours ago) neither has anyone deleted it.  I agree that it's spam and deserves deletion.  The problem may be that, promotional puffery that it is, it's been around for so long, but that can cut both ways.  —   ✉  

 (2) Jclemens has since declined db-g11 (diff), recommending  or AFD.  I did a spam cleanup, explaining why in my edit summary (diff).  —   ✉  

 Thank you. The broken external links should also be dealt with according to Wikipedia policy and citations requested for the majority of the information posted.

So you think being rude in an edit summary is something you need to leave messages about, but reverting productive work without explanation is something you can happily ignore?  Seems to me that's a very warped perspective and implicitly condones what you claim not to condone.  If you believe that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and if you want it to get better, you should rethink your priorities.  Sure, criticise my rude edit summaries if you like, but to simply ignore destructive edits like User:EncMstr's is not helpful to anyone.
If Wikipedia is going to declare itself """"the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""", then anonymous editors should not be discriminated against.  In practice, they are, by you and many, many others.  The solution to that is not for me or anyone else to create accounts but for those who actively discriminate to stop doing so.  At least you've taken the time to have a civil discussion.  That courtesy is frequently not given.  From another IP address a couple of months ago I wrote an entire article of, I think, very high quality, lengthy, well referenced, comprehensive, etc, etc, and then got blocked after someone reverted something I did with no explanation, and I reverted back.  No-one said a word about the article I wrote - all I got in return was a bunch of snotty templates and a block, for trying to reinstate good work.  Things like that make me pretty contemptuous of the culture here, and I am very unlikely to start assuming good faith when bad faith is constantly assumed of me, simply because I don't have a username. 190.161.134.66  """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions.

As I have said, over and over again, nobody disputes that some children may be alienated from their parents.  What is thoroughly in dispute (and almost totally discarded at this point) in the field is Gardner's conception of PAS, including existence, causality, treatment etc..  This is an article about PAS, and all of these aspects are already included included in the article. The influence of parents clearly is a point of contention as one of your own sources makes clear, and why all the newer conceptions (parental alienation, parental alienation disorder, etc) do not include the parent's actions as a criteria for the disorder.  But I'm repeating myself and will do so again. Your paragraph is not an accurate representation of either the sources you have provided, or of the literature in general.

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0

Mathematical Chemistry, Theoretical Chemistry, Computational Chemistry, etc

I am not so sure that you have got the definition of mathematical chemistry and its relationship to theoretical and computational chemistry exactly right. It tends to be used in a very restricted sense covering such direct mathematical ideas as graph theory and so on. The contents of the Journal of Mathematical Chemistry are very restricted. I do not think mathematical modeling is normally considered as part of mathematical chemistry. Your edit to Computational chemistry - """"Computational chemistry uses the results of theoretical chemistry, in particular, its branch mathematical chemistry"""" is not, I think really correct. The mathematics of the various methods of computational chemistry are important, but they are not considered, as far as I can see, as mathematical chemistry.

That said, the British grading system for coins works like this (I will not touch the lunatic American grading system with 70 different grades!):-

 Poor coins are very worn, and most of the detail of the coin will have gone, but you're still able to tell what type of coin it is.
 Fair coins are well worn, but more of the detail of the coin is visible, and it is easy to identify the coin.
 Good coins will have almost all the lettering readable, and the date will be easy to read in most cases.
 Very Good coins  will have all the coin readable, and some of the finer details of the design can start to be made out.
 Fine coins will have the details of the coins taking shape, and the coin is starting to become collectable if it's fairly recent.
 Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.
 Extremely Fine coins will have wear on only the highest points of the design.
 Uncirculated coins will have no wear on the high points of the design at all, though faults in the engraving, or wear on the die, may mean that the design may not be fully struck.

 Under no circumstances should collectible coins be cleaned or polished  this will destroy at least half its' collectible value.

Coming back to your 1862 penny, values for a bog-standard penny in UK Pounds, in Britain, are:

F - GBP 4
VF - GBP 10
EF - GBP 40
UNC - GBP 70

Lower grades are not worth anything much.

Multiply by 1.6 to get a US $ figure, then discount any amount for reduced interest in the coins in the States!

Oh I have gone ahead and done this. I think that page can be deleted now. There wasn't much on it. I hope you are happy with the way things are set out now. 

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them. 

that's all for now. There's plenty of work to do on all these though.12345 """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

 Debating whether I should toss my hat (and let my hair loss show) into the ArbCom election.

Copyvios on MP again

G'day SandyGeorgia. I thought you might be interested that I pulled an article from the main page today (T:ITN) that was a copyvio from start to finish: 2010 Colombia floods. It had been up for days and the copyvios were then when it was posted. I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big """"plagiarism on the main page"""" discussion. I thought you might be interested as I recall you were one of the main drivers of that discussion. If it's still ongoing, I'd be happy to join in. I've written a little rant/essay on the bottom of my userpage about my frustrations with the lack of main page scrutiny.  
 Hi, Mk I've also taken a few days off, and am ever-so-slowly catching up; starting at the bottom of the page is as good a place as any!  I actually did not intend to become a """"main driver"""" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become """"Plagiarism Central"""", but alas and alack, so it has turned out )  What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the """"reward culture"""" on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has.  Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at DYK or ITN (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle.   On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history.  You might want to go through those steps as well.   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously.

8506,"Is Deepak the ruler of the world? 

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0

 Vitamin B12 

Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect.
The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796

Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.

""""The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since.
http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml
""""Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980].
However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information.
Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

The last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from 2 MD personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin, without any reference to reliable sources.

The editor was also part of a dispute on the Vitamin_B12 article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vitamin_B12#POV_issues  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.

Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification.

Caps
Thanks for your input on the Pump RE caps. Between your links, and other things I've seen, it seems that this might be a case where un-specified usage (eg 'first cap') is usually referring to a 'national' cap, while narrower usages are usually self-identified, ie 'first county cap', 'first school cap', etc.?  18:55, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Seems right to me, the unqualified is usually the international. It seems to date to 1880 for football  and be of cricket origin. Also . 00:02, 2005 Feb 18 (UTC)

Probem editor  

Hi there. Just thought I'd get in touch regarding the above problem editor, who I notice seems to have recently targeted you for harrassment . I was made a target of harrassment, stalking and abuse by this editor late last year, and the matter even escalated to arbitration before being resolved in my favour. During an absence from Wikipedia of several months I have been contacted privately by several editors who claim to have been abused by  under similar circumstances to myself, so I'm currently exploring whether it may be worth iniating a formal disciplinary process to address 's history of inappropriate behaviour. Would you be willing to support such a process?  05:22, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy, by being arrogant, lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop. His worrying obsession with NFCC#9 is his excuse for being a twat. he is deliberately making the workshop non-functional. For the IW to work properly we have to be able to either see or be able to link to the image being requested. Now Mr Dick esq comes along, deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request. In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank. This I firmly definitely and firmly puts him in the """"dick"""" category. His arrogance, his laziness, his Borg-like obsession with NFCC#9 and his truculence are disrupting a valuable resource with WP for no purpose. I would be grateful if you could copy and paste this as a response to his accusations at the incident board. Especially now you've effectively stopped me posting there. This is not an unblock request as I don't care one way or another, it's WP's loss if I can't sort out image requests for 24hrs, it's not my loss.

You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it. You should not destroy, whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs.

Ben, you said “They do not profess to be inspired”, but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing, see quotes here 1 and here 2, why are you hiding this balance?

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda, and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia. I get the impression you are possibly a naïve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion (please don’t take offence at this, it is a common thing), and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct. Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors' hard work. Wikepedia is here for accurate information, be it good or bad, but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases.

 DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)   

DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)

Dr. A.B.Rajib Hazarika, PhD, MIAMP(Germany),FRAS(Lond.),MWASET,A.E.S.
Lecturer, Dept. of Mathematics,
Diphu Govt. College, Diphu
Assam, India
The present study is related different geometry of the Hall thrusters in which I have tried to get better results than the simple Hall thrusters available at present with the future next generation device Duo Triad Tokomak collider (DTTC) hub by the using new type of code Diffusion Associated Neoclassical Indigenous Hall Assembly (DANISHA).
Hall thrusters were studied independently in the US and the USSR in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former Soviet Union, whereas in the US, scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:
(A)Thruster with wide acceleration zone, SPD (Russian), SPT, (Stationary Plasma Thruster) at Design Bureau Fake. 
(B) Thruster with narrow acceleration zone, DAS in English: TAL, (Thruster with Anode Layer), at the Central Research Institute for Machine Building (TsNIIMASH). 
 
 
Soviet and Russian SPD thrusters
The common SPD design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. SPD engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPD engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 mN and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, SPD-180, T-160 and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. SPT-100 has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. 
Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently Hall Thruster research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at NASA Glenn Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as Aerojet and Busek Co.
This technology was used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. 
What's a Hall Thruster?    The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. Chemical rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. Plasmas can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters.
    A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained.  
    In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

From Fraser:

This article possesses a number of quite significant errors:

First, concerning the so-called characteristics of the deep house sound, many deep house tracks have a 'thumpy' bass drum sound, thus making them practicable for a dancefloor; although there is a wide use of effects employed in the production of deep house music, the use of filters etc., is no more prevalent than in other sub-genres of house, for instance disco house (where filters are used ad nauseum) and dub house (where reverb and echo are pronounced). 

In contrast to the traits mentioned in the article that characterise the deep house sound, I would argue that the most defining characteristic of the music is its mood, being typically abstract and atmospheric, more concerned with taking the listener on a mental expedition that making a dancefloor move.

Lastly, the statement that """"deep house music is often synonymous with 'Lounge Music'"""" is quite simply untrue and should not be kept in this article. Deep house music, although often possessing loungey characteristics, for example, vibraphones, smooth rhodes keys etc., never has and never will be seen as equivalent to lounge music. I am really quite shocked that such misinformation was put on the site; the person who wrote the article, whilst possessing some knowledge of the music, is well wide of the mark in a number of his or her comments.

I am basing all my judgments on being a DJ and avid deep house record collector for 10 years.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Speedy deletion of Cory dillard
 A tag has been placed on Cory dillard, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the sandbox for any other experiments you would like to do. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.
